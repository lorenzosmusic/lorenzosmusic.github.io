It was pretty cool so we kept it in.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Song took kind of a rock turn</h2><p>We liked the ideas that were happening. But now the guitar and drum parts changed the song's mood. Made it heavier.&nbsp;</p><p>Decided we wanted to see what else we could try.</p><p>We got some ideas that we're kicking around to see what more we can do with this and alter its direction again.</p><p>-Tom</p><div class="tomsbox"><h2 style="text-align: left;">Don't Forget!</h2><p>Want to see more live stream clips and videos?
