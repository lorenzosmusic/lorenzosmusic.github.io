Because I'm thinking Lorenzo Music. And then I'm thinking, Garfield.</h2><p>Yes, you are actually correct! That's where it came from.&nbsp;</p><p>And then the <i>apostrophe "S"</i> was added because we were afraid of getting sued so it was to confuse people. And what people used to think is it was like the movie <b>Lorenzo's Oil</b>. But it's been so long now, and more people are farther away from that movie that we don't get that reference as much anymore.&nbsp;</p><p>People are starting to figure out the Garfield connection again.&nbsp;</p><p>So the story of how we came up with our band name? Essentially what happened was, I came home one night when our drummer Rob and I first got the idea for the band it was back when <b>Nick at Nite</b> used to actually play much older television shows. So the <b>Bob Newhart Show</b> came on and the credits were rolling. Then I saw, created by <b>Lorenzo Music</b>&nbsp;on the screen and I was like, that would be a cool band name. And it was!</p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEixnkK9P3IUW_UQcvnOWLrCIt5zE9KbpVFKr0qeG1uuF0B7X9dGXka5qyeNS0CvPXH_4IR3ExhwLFKugw1IZm4Nuy7y4_YrGx4GfK2wOE_1mrSO3FnE5T743QeVkZraKfRZl5rN/s2048/IMG_20200325_140112.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img alt="picture of tv screen with people and words on it" border="0" data-original-height="1423" data-original-width="2048" height="445" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEixnkK9P3IUW_UQcvnOWLrCIt5zE9KbpVFKr0qeG1uuF0B7X9dGXka5qyeNS0CvPXH_4IR3ExhwLFKugw1IZm4Nuy7y4_YrGx4GfK2wOE_1mrSO3FnE5T743QeVkZraKfRZl5rN/w640-h445/IMG_20200325_140112.jpg" title="Bob Newhart Show credits with Lorenzo Music" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">How did we come up with our band name Lorenzo's Music?</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><p>So we started out with just "Lorenzo Music" as the name. And then we started playing shows in Chicago where the actual person Lorenzo Music lived at the time. He became aware of our name and his lawyer contacted us and asked if he could get a copy of our CD.&nbsp;</p><p>And then right after we sent it, we're like, well, let's adjust the band name. We put the apostrophe "S" on it. We even had a whole back story in case there were still issues. We were going, "and we can say it's about our friend Lorenzo. And the music is for him!"&nbsp;</p><p>But we never heard from Lorenzo Music or his lawyer again. And then, sadly, years later, he passed away. The name just stayed the way it was.&nbsp;</p><p>And also, I would just like to say at least once or twice a month people send me that <b>Rick and Morty</b> clip where they discuss Lorenzo music. How he was the voice of Garfield. And then also the voice of Peter Venkman in The Real Ghostbusters cartoon, who was played by Bill Murray in the movie, and Bill Murray was the voice of Garfield, in the live-action version of the movie.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" class="BLOG_video_class" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fOi_Xn3jVH4" width="320" youtube-src-id="fOi_Xn3jVH4"></iframe></div><p>Just in case anyone was wondering if I had seen that.</p><p>You can listen to the full episode of the podcast interview on the <b>BlocSonic</b> website <a href="https://blocsonic.com/bloccasts/episode/the-tom-ray-episode" target="_blank">https://blocsonic.com/bloccasts/episode/the-tom-ray-episode</a></p>
