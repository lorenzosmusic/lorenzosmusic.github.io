I was told recently that the link to our ROM-COMM MIXTAPE in both iTunes and Apple Music store shows this message:<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<b>"Item Not Available&nbsp;</b>The item you've requested is not currently available in Apple Music in the United States."</blockquote>
When I emailed about it, I was told that Apple:<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
"has more rigorous rules and it would be necessary [to] remove the information of the musical instruments in the name of the tracks so that your album can be distributed to this store."</blockquote>
Apparently,&nbsp;Apple frowns upon creative expression and can tell you how you should title the music you create. Who knew? Certainly not us since they never even sent us a notice explaining they took it down.<br />
<br />
So we are resubmitting the mixtape and it should be available again soon, with the abridged titles.<br />
<br />
<i><span style="color: #666666;"><b>Update:</b> Apple has accepted the abridged titles and the mixtape is back in their store. On a side note, every other music outlet allowed the way we chose to title our songs. I'm just sayin'. -Tom</span></i>
