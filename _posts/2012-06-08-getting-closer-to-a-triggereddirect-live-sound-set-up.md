We've been working on a live set up where we could use the sounds and effects that are more like what is actually on our albums. So here is a test run of our song <a href="http://lorenzosmusic.bandcamp.com/track/voomp-boomp" target="_blank">Voomp Boomp</a>.<br />
<br />
Rob created a triggered drum set mounting them inside and replacing the heads with mesh. We run these through a midi brain that plays sound samples in <a href="http://www.renoise.com/" target="_blank">Renoise</a> on an ASUS netbook running <a href="http://www.bandshed.net/AVLinux.html" target="_blank">AVLinux</a>. And all the other instruments and vocals run direct through a mixing board into <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.avid.com/US/" rel="homepage" target="_blank" title="Pro Tools">ProTools</a>, with the effects we used from the original recording. We were pretty happy with the outcome.<br />
