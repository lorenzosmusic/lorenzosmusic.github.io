And they still call us back every year to play in the St. Patrick's day parade.<br /><br />Most of the members have moved away and we just throw together musicians we can find to do it each year.<br /><br />This time we found that our line-up was mostly Lorenzo's Music based, with Me (Tom), Bryan, Scott, Mark and our old bass player Chris Boeger.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4044/4432913046_ca13646382_m.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4044/4432913046_ca13646382_m.jpg" /></a></div>It's always fun and very strange. Here's a Pope on stilts that came up to talk to us while we were waiting for the parade to start.<br /><br />For fun we started playing "Do you think I'm Sexy" by Rod Stewart and the Pope on stilts was dancing and singing along. But by the time I got my camera out I had missed it.<br /><object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" data="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=71377" height="300" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="400"> <param name="flashvars" value="intl_lang=en-us&photo_secret=f1b4b3b790&photo_id=4434737588"></param><param name="movie" value="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=71377"></param><param name="bgcolor" value="#000000"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=71377" bgcolor="#000000" allowfullscreen="true" flashvars="intl_lang=en-us&photo_secret=f1b4b3b790&photo_id=4434737588" height="300" width="400"></embed></object>
