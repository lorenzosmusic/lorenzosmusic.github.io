So, I'm listening to the roughs of the new single that we're working on called <b>"Picture it all"</b> and it's really hard for me not to just post it!<br />
<!--more-->Mark sent me the latest version and I just want to post a copy of what he sent me, even before it's finished.<br />
<br />
But they hate it when I do that.<br />
<br />
Those of you that are <a href="http://eepurl.com/pKNRj" target="_blank">subscribed to our mailing list</a> know I already leaked a live take I recorded on my phone just to get an opinion on it while we were writing it.<br />
<br />
I just finished the cover artwork for it, as you can see above, so I thought I could at least post that.<br />
It really kinda fits with the song.<br />
<br />
This photo is one I took from a hotel room in <b>Seattle, WA</b>.<br />
Throughout&nbsp;the day this&nbsp;seagull&nbsp;would land at this same spot and just look around, not 20 feet away from my window.<br />
Then fly away.<br />
Then come back later.<br />
Then fly away.<br />
Then come back later.<br />
<br />
After about the 4th time I wanted to get a picture of it, just so I could remember it.<br />
<br />
I took the picture and that was the end of it.<br />
<br />
When I looked at the photo to show somebody later, I realized in the picture that the seagull had turned towards me and cocked it's head and looked back.<br />
Kind of like it was thinking, <i>"What ya doin' there?".</i><br />
<br />
I became another moment on this birds stoop.<br />
I'm another reason that it comes back to this spot.<br />
