A while back, we posted a recording we made while we were writing this song. <br />
<br />
The people over at <a href="http://www.machinima.com/">Machinima.com</a> used it as the background music for their video "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN9eSA0tl2U">3 Last Ways To Annoy In By Injecti0n (MW2 Countdown)</a>". <br />
And "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9up6Y0PK4M">5 More Ways To Annoy In Left 4 Dead 2 (L4D2 Machinima)</a>".<br />
<br />

As you can hear it's changed a little since then.<br />
<br />
We're thinking of taking some of the <a href="http://www.lorenzosmusic.com/search/label/single">recent singles we've released</a> and putting them together as a physical EP/CD and a version on vinyl in the next month.
