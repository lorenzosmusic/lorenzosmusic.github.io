{% include video-embed.html video_id="Igs37DW7pUA" title="Go on for miles - Tom Ray Live Stream Solo Performance" %}<p>This clip is from <a href="https://youtu.be/dxdaqD6PQzA" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a full live stream performance I did on our YouTube channel</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>For this song from our <a href="https://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2018/08/rom-comm-mixtape.html">Rom-Comm Mixtape</a>, I started using my own soundscape type stuff in it. It's got the sound of the lake that's actually right around where I live in the background of it. If you listen to the song on the album itself you can hear it.&nbsp;</p><p>This song is called "Go on for miles" and <a href="https://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2018/10/go-on-for-miles-music-video.html">we also have a video of this one</a> that's from a short the was released on Vimeo from a film called "Det vi ikke ser" which means "What we do not see".&nbsp;</p><p>That short film was released under the same creative commons license that we use and I think it worked perfectly for the feeling of the song.</p><p>In the film, the story was about a couple breaking up and as the boyfriend walks out the door he relives moments from their past. I thought it fit really well with the music.</p><p>You can view the whole live stream performance on YouTube <a href="https://youtu.be/dxdaqD6PQzA" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/dxdaqD6PQzA</a></p>
