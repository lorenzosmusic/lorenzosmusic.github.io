Now I need to upload these changes to GitHub.com to put them in the GitHub repository that we'll be using to share these DAW files with each other.<span></span></p><!--more--><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Sharing recording sessions to GitHub</h2><p style="text-align: left;">Now we are going to add the recording changes to the remote repository on GitHub.com by “pushing” (uploading) the local repository folder to it.</p><p style="text-align: left;">First, let's go over some of the terminology we are going to use because the words are a little different for GitHub.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Here are the terms we will be using and what they mean.</p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>"Add" looks for new changes made</li><li>"Commit" marks these added changes for upload</li><li>"Push" is uploading changes</li><li>"Pull" is downloading changes</li></ul><p></p><p style="text-align: left;">I said in the last post, as an example, I've recorded the drums after creating the DAW session in the GitHub repository I cloned to my computer, and now I need to put the recording sessions online for collaboration.</p><p style="text-align: left;">But I have to do a few steps first before doing this.</p><p style="text-align: left;">(<b>Related Post:</b> <a href="https://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2025/05/github-for-music-setting-up-daw-session.html">GitHub For Music: Setting Up A DAW Session For GitHub</a>)</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Save and close the DAW</h2><p style="text-align: left;">First, I need to shut down the DAW completely before I add these changes to GitHub.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: left;">Sometimes when you close a program, it actually does some work behind the scenes in the actual code of the program itself, and we don't want those to be left out when it's uploaded to GitHub.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">"Add" or look for all the changes in the local folder</h2><p style="text-align: left;">This part of the process is a little&nbsp;strange to understand at first, because the GitHub repository folder we cloned to our computer isn't a folder that syncs automatically.&nbsp; It's a folder that has GitHub in it, and it just kind of sits there and waits for you to tell GitHub when something happened.</p><p style="text-align: left;">So first, I need to tell GitHub that I've made changes, and I do that by using the GitHub Desktop app by choosing "Add" the changes.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: left;">GitHub will then look for new changes made in the folder of the session.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">"Commit" or mark the changes in the local folder</h2><p style="text-align: left;">Next, I'm gonna "commit" those changes I added. I know because of the word "commit" that this makes it sound like I've uploaded them to GitHub now, but I have not.</p><p style="text-align: left;">As I mentioned in the list of terms above, it's really just putting a marker on the changes. The GitHub Desktop is just being told, there are a bunch of new files here in the folder, I want you to mark them for upload.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">"Push" or upload the changes</h2><p style="text-align: left;">Now we need to "push" the changes to upload them to GitHub. In another strange terminology word, I'm not uploading them, I'm going to push those changes.</p><p style="text-align: left;">They all mean the same thing; they're just different ways of saying it. And again, it's confusing, but yes, it's not in GitHub.com until you've pushed the changes.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: left;">So now that we've added the changes, committed the changes, and then pushed them, they are now officially on the GitHub repository.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">More later...</h2><p style="text-align: left;">You can go to GitHub and see that the changes are there, and there should also be a message at the top of the repository that says there has been a recent update.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Next, I will go over how the band members can clone their own version of the DAW repository to work on.</p><div class="tomsbox"><h2 style="text-align: center;">Download My GitHub For Music Process</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-align: left;"><b>GitHub for Music Collaboration With A Full DAW Is Possible...
