<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/24156392">Survival of the fittest</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/user5470489">Artur Przysiecki</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<div>About a month ago we were contacted on Facebook by Arthur from Germany asking if he could use our music in a movie short he was making. He had found us on <a href="https://www.jamendo.com/artist/340710/lorenzo-s-music">Jamendo</a> while looking for creative commons music for the project, a 3D animated short for his diploma thesis.<br />
<br />
It's a pretty damn good film! Nice work!<br />
<br />
The film is released under the Non-Commercial, Non-Derivative license <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.creativecommons.org/" rel="homepage" title="Creative Commons licenses">CC-BY-NC-ND</a> because the song "<a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/track/391002">Balrog Boogie</a>" by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.myspace.com/diabloswingorchestra">Diablo Swing Orchestra</a> was under that license. He asked us if he could use our music under the same, which we of course said yes.<br />
<br />
Enjoy.</div>
