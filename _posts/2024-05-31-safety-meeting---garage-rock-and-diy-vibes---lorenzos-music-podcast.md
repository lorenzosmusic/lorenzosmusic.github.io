The band has a unique blend of garage rock and art punk.</p><p>Keith's journey into music started in high school, playing in small bands at birthday parties and school dances. It wasn't until he moved into his first apartment and met his neighbor, a drummer, that Safety Meeting was born. "We just wanted free drinks," Keith laughs.</p><p>Safety Meeting recorded their first EP in a basement then worked up to building a home studio in Keith's garage. Their music videos are creatively shot and edited by the band members themselves, often using nothing more than a smartphone and a green screen.</p><p>Their music is described by Keith as not quite punk but not quite rock. Influenced by bands like Parquet Courts, they embrace the term "art punk" to describe their sound.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Links</h2><p>Safety Meeting Bandcamp -&nbsp;<a href="https://safetymeeting69.bandcamp.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://safetymeeting69.bandcamp.com</a></p><p>Safety Meeting YouTube -&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@safety.meeting" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/@safety.meeting</a></p><p>Safety Meeting Spotify -&nbsp;<a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/51eZgSiPMthoNnblgautzU" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://open.spotify.com/artist/51eZgSiPMthoNnblgautzU</a></p><p><br /></p>
