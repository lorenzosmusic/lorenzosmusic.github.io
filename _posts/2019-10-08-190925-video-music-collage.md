<br />
Part of a series we are working on. The concept is a song from a video music collage.<br />
<br />
We record a <b>2-hour live stream songwriting session</b> and create a song out of several different video clips from it.<br />
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
The video segments have been cut up, arranged, looped and layered into a song format.</div>
