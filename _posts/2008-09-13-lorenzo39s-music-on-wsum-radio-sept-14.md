</tbody></table>This Sunday at 2pm <span style="font-weight: bold;">Lorenzo's Music</span> will be on <span style="font-style: italic;">"Support Your Scene"</span>. A local music show on Madison Student Radio <span style="font-weight: bold;">WSUM 91.7 FM</span>  promoting songs from our new album <b>"Bazar"</b>, which you can download for free on our <a href="http://www.lorenzosmusic.com/audio.html">audio page</a>.<br />
<div><blockquote cite="Music department | WSUM 91.7 Madison Student Radio"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WSUM</span> is very pro-local music. They have shows dedicated to local music, and love to work with local (and not-so-local) bands.</blockquote></div>We did an impromptu performance on the show last year showcasing some of the songs from the new album that we were in the studio recording at the time. <a href="http://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2007/03/lorenzo-live-on-wsum-madison.html">You can listen to that whole show here on our website.</a><br />
<br />
If you're not in the Madison area on Sunday Sept. 14th at 2pm you can still listen to the show online at <a href="http://wsum.org/">WSUM.org</a><br />
