The duo, consisting of <b>Nicole Barille</b> and <b>Sam Meister</b>, have been making music for years with a DIY approach. In this episode, we talk about their creative process and the release of their new album.<span></span></p><!--more--><p></p><p>Mr. Gnome started as a two-piece band and has evolved significantly over the years. They are currently on tour promoting their latest album <b>A Sliver of Space.</b></p><p>Touring has always been a big part of Mr. Gnome. They talk about how every major opportunity in their career has come from playing live shows. Their grassroots, DIY approach has not only helped them grow as musicians but also allowed them to maintain a close connection with their audience.</p><p>One of the most compelling parts of our discussion was about their decision to start their own record label. They took a bold step to maintain control over their music. They shared some of the challenges and learning experiences they faced along the way, emphasizing the importance of being smart about business decisions in the music industry.</p><p>The new album A Sliver of Space, which was recorded in their home studio, reflects a period of intense personal experiences and emotions. Nicole and Sam talked about how music has been a saving grace for them during tough times, providing an outlet for their feelings and creativity.</p><p>Listen to the full conversation to hear more!</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Links</h2><p>Mr. Gnome will be playing in Madison <a href="https://gammaray.bar/show/mr-gnome-with-special-guests-pink-frost/" target="_blank">at The Gamma Ray Bar on Oct 10, 2024</a></p><p>Mr. Gnome Website - <a href="https://www.mrgnome.com" target="_blank">https://www.mrgnome.com</a></p><p>Mr. Gnome on Instagram - <a href="https://instagram.com/mrgnomemusic" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://instagram.com/mrgnomemusic</a></p><p><br /></p>
