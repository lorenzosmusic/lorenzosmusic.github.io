<h3>
An interesting story about our one degree of separation from the movie Hardcore Henry</h3>
<b>We are not connected with the film “Hardcore Henry” in any way</b>. But I do have an interesting story about how I met the creator of the film through his band <b><a href="http://bitingelbows.com/" target="_blank">Biting Elbows</a></b>.<br />
<br />

<br />
It all started on a creative commons music podcast I do called <a href="http://www.musicmanumit.com/2015/01/biting-elbows-150118-music-manumit.html" target="_blank">Music Manumit</a>.<br />
<br />
About a year ago back in January of 2015. I did an interview on my podcast with <b>Ilya Naishuller from The Biting Elbows</b>. <br />
<br />
They're based out of Russia and they had two videos they released for their songs <b>"The Stampede"</b> and <b>"Bad Motherfucker"</b>.<br />
<br />
They're shot in the first person shooter style and they’re pretty amazing. <br />
<br />
So when I had him on the podcast we were going to just be talking about his band <b>Biting Elbows</b>. <br />
<br />
But he was in the middle of a crowdfunding campaign to take the concept of what he does in his music videos to make it a full-length feature film.<br />
<br />
This ended up becoming the film "<a href="http://www.stxmovies.com/hardcorehenry/" target="_blank">Hardcore Henry</a>" which was released this year in theaters across the country.<br />
<br />
I was so interested in his music <b>we decided to do a cover of their song "The Stampede"</b> which was released under a Creative Commons license.<br />
<br />

Here is the original video by Biting Elbows</h4>

To mix things up a bit we wrote our version more in the style of the spy song Peter Gunn from 1959 by Henry Mancini.<br />
