Instead of the standard ska horns, you are going to hear some oft-neglected saxophone punctuated with some upbeat ska guitar &amp; drum “pick-it-ups”, all overlayed with the distinct vocals of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tom Ray</span> and some brilliant harmonization and frenzied instrumental execution throughout.</blockquote>  <p class="citation">    <cite cite="http://insomniaradio.net/2008/09/04/lorenzos-music-downtown/">      <a href="http://insomniaradio.net/2008/09/04/lorenzos-music-downtown/">Lorenzo’s Music: Downtown : Insomnia Radio: Indie Music Network</a>    </cite>  </p> </div>click the link to hear this and more from other artists
