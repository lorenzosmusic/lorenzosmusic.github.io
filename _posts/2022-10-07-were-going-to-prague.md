We've been invited to play at the Ubuntu Summit in Prague in November!</p><p><span style="background-color: #fcff01;">(Check out how it went here: <a href="https://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2022/11/performing-at-ubuntu-summit-prague.html">OUR FIRST SHOW IN EUROPE - PERFORMING AT THE UBUNTU SUMMIT IN PRAGUE</a>)</span></p><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">How did this happen?</h2><p><a href="https://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2019/01/s01-episode-6-erich-eickmeyer-ubuntu.html">On a podcast, I talked with Erich Eickmeyer</a>, the lead for the Ubuntu Studio operating system we use. It's a production suite that comes with open-source audio recording, video editing, and design software pre-installed.</p><p style="text-align: left;">I talked with Erich on the podcast because I wanted to meet the person that runs <a href="https://ubuntustudio.org/" target="_blank">Ubuntu Studio</a> just to geek out about what they do.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Well, last month <b>Canonical</b>, the company that runs all of the different versions of the Ubuntu operating system asked Erich if there were any musicians that use Ubuntu Studio that would be a good fit for the conference in November.</p><p style="text-align: left;">And Erich told them to contact us!</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">We're flying there to play the wrap party</h2><p style="text-align: left;">They asked us to play at the wrap party for the <b>Ubuntu Summit in Prague</b> and we're pretty psyched about all of this!</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">I'll also be doing a talk</h2><p style="text-align: left;">On top of that, I've been asked to do a talk about Ubuntu Studio for music. I'll be talking about how the band uses Ubuntu Studio, Ardour, and <a href="https://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2019/05/how-we-came-up-with-way-to-use-github.html">GitHub to collaborate on writing and recording music</a> remotely.</p><p style="text-align: left;"><br /></p><p style="text-align: left;"><br /></p>
