This is part of dane101's series looking back on 2007 and forward at 2008 through the eyes of local politicians, musicians, organizations, and businesses<br />
<br />
So....2007...how was it?<br />
<br />
The year was pretty good for us. Most of it was working on new songs, ideas and the like. Plus the addition of two new children for Mark Whitcomb and Bryan Elliott (seperatly, not together.) And we've branched into the realm of video casting in relation to the new material we've been working on.<br />
<br />
What do you have on tap for 2008?<br />
<br />
We have a new album in the works as well as creating a new website. And, just like the last time our new album will be free for download.</blockquote>
