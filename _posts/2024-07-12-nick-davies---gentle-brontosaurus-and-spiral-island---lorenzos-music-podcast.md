Known for his work with the band Gentle Brontosaurus, Nick has ventured into a solo project called Spiral Island.</p><p>Nick's journey with music began over a decade ago with Gentle Brontosaurus, a band that has seen many changes and evolutions over the years. Celebrating their ten-year anniversary, the band has been a staple in the Madison music scene. Nick also started Spiral Island, a solo endeavor that allows him to explore different genres and sounds that don't quite fit into the Gentle Brontosaurus mold.</p><p>The first Spiral Island album was released in 2017. His new album, set to release in August, promises to be a diverse collection of songs influenced by genres like shoegaze, post-rock, dance pop, and even Euro-pop.</p><p>Nick talks about participating in February Album Writing Month, a challenge where musicians aim to write 14 songs in 28 days. Many of the tracks on his upcoming album originated from this challenge.</p><p>Check out Spiral Island on Bandcamp - <a href="https://spiralisland.bandcamp.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://spiralisland.bandcamp.com</a></p><p><br /></p>
