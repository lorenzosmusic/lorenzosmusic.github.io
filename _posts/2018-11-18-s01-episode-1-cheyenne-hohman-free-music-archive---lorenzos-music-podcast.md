This is the first episode of our new podcast. The Lorenzo’s Music Podcast. This is a show about people who make music, promote music or video or people who like to make things. Stuff like that.<br />
<br />
This Episode I talk to Cheyenne Hohman from the <b>Free Music Archive,</b>&nbsp;a site that has been one of the biggest sources where people have discovered music that is free to use in&nbsp;videos, films, mobile app projects and more.<br />
<br />
Soon after we recorded this interview, Cheyanne found out that&nbsp;<a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/member/cheyenne_h/blog/Update_Closing_Date_Pushed_to_Dec_1" target="_blank">the site would be ending it’s long run and shutting down</a>. Which is a huge loss for musicians all over the world.<br />
But Cheyenne has done so much to support music that I wanted to focus on her as a music fan. So this episode is a tribute to what she's done.<br />
