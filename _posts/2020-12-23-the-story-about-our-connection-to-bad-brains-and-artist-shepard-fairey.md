She was a graphic designer. We were doing our first EP and she found this 1930s space-themed world's fair artwork from Chicago.</p><div><div style="text-align: left;"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjnmwjVDi3Ny3aDuiDOahwSTjCsejrgqYtHQCkIXf0ZrzZSuPzburWXSaRqQQwR_clwEsRdkswAGUFKT8h1XujbBTi3YgeTrVQgCoZzu23mjWxWO949Q17yatsWbb-W46DYMkTzqQ/s1024/1933-worls-fair-chicago-logo-planet.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img alt="image of vintage poster artwork print blue on white background" border="0" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjnmwjVDi3Ny3aDuiDOahwSTjCsejrgqYtHQCkIXf0ZrzZSuPzburWXSaRqQQwR_clwEsRdkswAGUFKT8h1XujbBTi3YgeTrVQgCoZzu23mjWxWO949Q17yatsWbb-W46DYMkTzqQ/w291-h400/1933-worls-fair-chicago-logo-planet.jpg" title="Vintage 1933 World's Fair artwork poster" width="291" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-align: start;">Vintage 1933 Chicago World's Fair Poster</span></td></tr></tbody></table><p>It was a picture of a planet with a ring that swooped around it. And she was like, I want to design the album just like this! And I was like, that's fantastic! So she did.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Years went by, and then in the mid-2000s the band <b>Bad Brains</b> had <b>Shepard Fairy</b> do the artwork for the cover of their album "<a href="https://amzn.to/3aFaVLE">Into The Future</a>".</p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><blockquote>"And I'm looking at it going holy crap! Did they use our album artwork? That's awesome!"</blockquote><p></p><p style="text-align: left;">I was listening to the album and looking at the cover and all of a sudden I'm like, wait a minute?! I turned it upside down and realized that's the design on our first album!</p></div><div style="text-align: left;"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEik6dxkKB54zXktooU_QHvn5G7oyEknuSpu2yccnLhdokEgc7pcmvB5tB7BWABDFUMsCDzfHv4mHoZxXbJI1a7ihDL8bwK2OT2NtzKk27bzasbUF1ZdaEKNkhzmLBWSkMvs8JWNSQ/s640/bad-brains-lorenzos-music-album-artwork.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img alt="image of music album artwork for CDs" border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEik6dxkKB54zXktooU_QHvn5G7oyEknuSpu2yccnLhdokEgc7pcmvB5tB7BWABDFUMsCDzfHv4mHoZxXbJI1a7ihDL8bwK2OT2NtzKk27bzasbUF1ZdaEKNkhzmLBWSkMvs8JWNSQ/w640-h320/bad-brains-lorenzos-music-album-artwork.png" title="Bad Brains and Lorenzo's Music Album Artwork" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-align: start;">Bad Brains and Lorenzo's Music Album Artwork</span></td></tr></tbody></table><p>And I'm looking at it going holy crap! Did they use our album artwork? That's awesome! I thought it was cool and I posted it on the band's website.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Next thing you know, it got picked up on Reddit and then a bunch of music and tabloid outlets started posting the story. All of a sudden these headlines were saying, <i>"Did Bad Brains steal this artwork?"</i> and all this kind of stuff. And I was like, I didn't say that. I just pointed out it was the same artwork.</p></div><div style="text-align: left;"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg8q54NiuS3XBauzRCVomdrbiyRHt40PZ6UQq2xd6vNhyRSeDLhXrNzl7M9iaa2AJcWBMt0ZnGGqItrSDOUNCdSBaF-u_a56z1sZjWGkwqlJZ-lklIW4OX05mW8D_GV84Jm1X61gw/s1371/Screenshot+from+2020-12-15+00-24-21.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img alt="screenshot of music blog article" border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg8q54NiuS3XBauzRCVomdrbiyRHt40PZ6UQq2xd6vNhyRSeDLhXrNzl7M9iaa2AJcWBMt0ZnGGqItrSDOUNCdSBaF-u_a56z1sZjWGkwqlJZ-lklIW4OX05mW8D_GV84Jm1X61gw/w640-h360/Screenshot+from+2020-12-15+00-24-21.png" title="Lorenzo's Music and Bad Brains music article screenshot" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-align: start;">Lorenzo's Music/Bad Brains news article</span></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><p>All of a sudden all of the people who like Bad Brains came out and they're just like hating on us!</p><p>And also this is what I didn't know. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama_%22Hope%22_poster#Origin_and_copyright_issues">Shepard Fairey was actually going through the court case for the Obama hope artwork at the time</a> and I had no concept that he was literally being sued for appropriating someone's photography and here I said this about him using our artwork. And everybody's like he's doing it again!</p><p>So Shepard Fairey actually called me on the phone! We had a really nice conversation about it and I said I just thought it was cool that Bad Brains had the same artwork as us. But yeah, we got bashed online because of that.</p><p style="text-align: left;">But also our listenership went up tons because of the exposure! We still got new band email list signups. So with the hating also brought people going, oh check out this band that's really cool! sort of thing.</p><p style="text-align: left;">- Tom</p><p style="text-align: left;"><br /></p></div></div>
