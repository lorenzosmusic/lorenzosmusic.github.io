From time to time we get contacted by people asking to use our music in videos and movies. That's the case with the people that I talk with on this episode of the podcast.<br />

They made an independent&nbsp;film that they are entering in the film fest circuits&nbsp;and it's called "Feet". So needless to say I had to get them on the show to learn more about what this thing was all about.<br />
