The <a href="http://downloadfreepunkalbums.blogspot.com">Download Free Punk Albums mp3 blog</a> featured us on the site recently and had an interesting take on what the band sounded like.<br /><blockquote cite="http://downloadfreepunkalbums.blogspot.com/2009/07/about-this-blog-click-lorenzos-music-is.html">"Lorenzo's Music is one of those odd little creations you find and just don't quite know how to describe.  My best attempt would be to say that they feel like a rock and jazz version of cabaret punkers The World/Inferno Friendship Society." </blockquote><cite cite="http://downloadfreepunkalbums.blogspot.com/2009/07/about-this-blog-click-lorenzos-music-is.html"><a href="http://downloadfreepunkalbums.blogspot.com/2009/07/about-this-blog-click-lorenzos-music-is.html">Download Free Punk Albums: Lorenzo's Music - Three Albums</a></cite><br /><br />Thanks to VultureDude for the post!
