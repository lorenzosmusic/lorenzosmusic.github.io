How does an artist take an original track and transform it into something fresh and new, while still retaining its core essence?<span></span></p><!--more--><p></p><p>We delve into the creative process behind the remix <b>Joshua Hudes</b> from <a href="https://blocsonic.com/artists/louis-lingg-and-the-bombs/" target="_blank">Louis Lingg and the Bombs</a> did of our song <i>"Slippery Friction"</i> for our <a href="https://blocsonic.com/releases/lorenzos-music/lorenzos-remixes-volume-1/" target="_blank">"Lorenzo's Remixes, Volume 1" album on the blocSonic Netlabel</a>.</p><p>Josh, a seasoned music producer, takes us through creating this remix. It all started with a spark of inspiration from the original track. "When I listened to your record, all the songs kind of spoke to me. But 'Slippery Friction' especially screamed <b>distortion!</b>" he shares. This initial inspiration set the tone for the entire project.</p><p>Josh emphasizes, "The only thing that's important in a project is artistic intent." This guiding principle helped shape the direction of the remix.</p><p>For the drums in the remix he combined industrial drum loops made from distorted scrap metal sounds with the original drums. He chose to keep the original drums intact saying "If it's good, don't break it," while adding his creative touch.</p><p>Another fascinating inspiration was the influence of the found sounds and music concrete movement drawing inspiration from those avant-garde composers. He incorporated elements of industrial music to create a rich, textured soundscape. He shares an anecdote about one of those bands that made an entire record using only sounds from a stolen shopping cart.</p><p>Vocals in the remix also received special treatment. Using plugins like <a href="https://www.izotope.com/en/products/trash.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iZotope's Trash</a> and experimental reverb effects. The result is a blend of distorted and radio-like sounds.</p><p>One of the most intriguing techniques we talk about is the use of <a href="https://www.celemony.com/en/start" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Melodyne</a> to extract MIDI from the original bassline. This allowed Josh to seamlessly integrate synthesizers into the remix. "I just put the bass into Melodyne and then told auto-tune to give me the MIDI file notes," he explains, showcasing a clever hack that saved time.</p><p>Listen to the full video to get more insights into Josh's music production!</p><div class="tomsbox"><h2 style="text-align: center;">Listen to the album!</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><b>Lorenzo's Remixes, Volume 1</b></p><p style="text-align: center;"><a class="fancy-button button flat-button" href="https://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2024/07/lorenzos-remixes-volume-1.html">Listen to the album</a></p></div><p style="text-align: left;"><br /></p>
