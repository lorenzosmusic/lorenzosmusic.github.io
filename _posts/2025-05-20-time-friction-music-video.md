Born from a live-stream songwriting session, the song is a one-take freeform jazz experiment.</p><p>The video is actual live one-take footage that was used to create the song for the album. A tuning fork even fell during the recording! 😂</p><p>During a live stream, Tom played the bass notes on a keyboard while Rob improvised on guitar. Then, on the same stream, we played back that recording, and Rob played along on drums with brushes in one take. Then the same was done with Eric playing piano. None of us had ever played any of this before.</p><p>(<b>Watch more</b>: <a href="https://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2022/09/down-time-guitars-drums-and-bass-multi-track.html">Here is the original live session with Tom and Rob</a>)</p><p>The video was made using only open-source recording software, Ardour, KDENLive, and OBS on Ubuntu Studio, a computer operating system for musicians and artists.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Subscribe to our YouTube channel</h2><p>See more videos and get alerts when we do our live streams!</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@lorenzosmusic" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Subscribe to Lorenzo's Music on YouTube</a></p><p><br /></p>
