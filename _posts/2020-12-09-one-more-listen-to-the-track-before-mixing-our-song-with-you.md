<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">{% include video-embed.html video_id="lZQAXurdVww" title="One more listen to the track before mixing our song \"With you\"" %}</div>We've been testing out our new experimental process for recording music remotely with GitHub using the open-source recording software Ardour in Ubuntu studio.<p></p><p>It started with <a href="https://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2020/11/brainstorming-using-github-for-music.html" target="">an idea about ways to record music</a> since we haven't been able to play music together in the same room all year.</p><p>Then <a href="https://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2020/12/first-song-branch-idea-github-for-music.html">I recorded the first idea</a> I had and shared it with the rest of the band.</p><p>After that <a href="https://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2020/12/song-branch-with-you-guitar-added.html">Rob had added drums and Eric wrote a guitar track</a> and shared it back.</p><p>Now with bass added I take one more listen to see what we got from our GitHub writing branch for this song before mixing it and getting it ready for release.</p><p>-Tom</p>
