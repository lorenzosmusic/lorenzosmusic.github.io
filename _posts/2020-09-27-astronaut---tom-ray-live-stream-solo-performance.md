<div style="text-align: center;">{% include video-embed.html video_id="DPl5S4M4fOA" title="Astronaut - Tom Ray Live stream Solo Performance" %}</div><div><br /></div><div>I set up to do a live stream with the band's music on our <a href="https://youtube.com/lorenzosmusic" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a> and when I felt like everything was running correctly I just began the live stream.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>I don't know what the sound is like to people watching but I know what it sounds like to me. I'm going through my PA speakers in our practice studio.</div><div><br /></div><div>For this song, I've got two mics that I use while I'm singing this song called "Astronaut" a regular mic and a harmonica bullet mic. It was funny because during the stream I gotta remember not to talk into the harmonica mic because it sounds good when I'm singing through it but not so much for talking.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>This is the first song on our <a href="https://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2018/08/rom-comm-mixtape.html">Rom-Comm Mixtape</a>. it's actually the first song that we wrote for this particular venture. The song was based around a sound sample that we found at freesound.org a place where you can download free sound samples and recordings that are free to use under creative commons license.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>While Rob and I were searching on there looking for a sound there was this one recording that said it was a sound from an airport terminal. But the way it recorded was really weird sounding and I created a loop out of this one section of it. it was originally like a five-minute soundscape thing.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>It seemed kind of cool so that's what this song is based on is just this weird little loop that Rob and I based the idea of this song on.</div><div><br /></div><div>You can watch the full live stream performance on YouTube <a href="https://youtu.be/dxdaqD6PQzA" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/dxdaqD6PQzA</a></div><div><br /></div><div>- Tom</div><div><br /></div>
