One of the standout features of Mirlo is its subscription model, which allows fans to support their favorite artists directly through monthly contributions from supporters.</p><p>What sets Mirlo apart is its commitment to cooperative ownership. Unlike many music platforms that rely on venture capital funding, Mirlo is built on the principles of mutual aid and solidarity economy. Simon explains that the platform was born out of a desire to create a space where musicians can have a say in how the platform operates, ensuring that the needs of artists are prioritized.</p><p>During the conversation, Simon shares insights into the challenges of building Mirlo from the ground up. He emphasizes the importance of transparency and community feedback in shaping the platform's development. He highlights that the platform is still in its early stages, but the potential for growth and impact is significant.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Links</h2><p>Visit Mirlo to learn more - <a href="https://mirlo.space" target="_blank">https://mirlo.space</a></p><div class="tomsbox" id="HTML11"><h2 style="text-align: center;">📄 Download The Toolkit!</h2><p>Get a List of Open-Source Tools Indie Musicians Use to Be Independent.</p><p>Including self-hosted, free, and open alternatives for owning your video sites, live-streams, music stores, and more!</p><p><a href="https://mailchi.mp/lorenzosmusic/opensourcemusic" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Get The Toolkit Here!</a></p></div><p><br /></p>
