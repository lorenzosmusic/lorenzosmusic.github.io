Toucon's sound is an eclectic mix of indie vibes and alternative rap. We talk about his creative process, from producing beats for rap artists to writing his own lyrics and melodies. His approach to songwriting is both methodical and inspired, a balancing act between structure and spontaneity.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Links</h2><p>Toucon on Spotify - <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/5m9Arsu1Lxf5DPPGDYL7Ww" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://open.spotify.com/artist/5m9Arsu1Lxf5DPPGDYL7Ww</a></p><p>Toucon on Instagram - <a href="https://www.instagram.com/touconofficial" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.instagram.com/touconofficial</a></p><p><br /></p>
