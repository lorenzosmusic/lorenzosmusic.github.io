Onesie has been carving out a niche in the indie music scene with its unique blend of power pop and punk influences.<span></span></p><!--more--><p></p><p>Ben shares the origins of Onesie, which began as a solo songwriting project around 2013-2014. Over the years, it evolved into a full-fledged band. Their debut record came out in 2017, and since then, they’ve been consistently releasing music.</p><p>We also talked about the challenges and rewards of being an indie band in a city like New York. Ben runs a practice space in Greenpoint, which he manages and shares with other bands and musicians. This setup not only provides a consistent place for Onesie to rehearse but also fosters a sense of community among local artists. It’s a great example of the DIY indie music scene.</p><p>While they’ve played numerous shows in the tri-state area, they’ve also ventured further, including tours in Europe with previous bands. Ben talks about the importance of careful planning and collaboration when booking shows.</p><p>We also talk about their recent music video for the song “What You Kill.” The video features a psychedelic animation created by a talented director from Budapest, showcasing the power of cross-continental collaboration. It’s a visually stunning piece that perfectly complements the song’s post-punk vibe.</p><p>Onesie has a new single set to release on August 9th, and they’re planning more shows and potential tours in the coming months.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Links</h2><p>Onesie on Bandcamp -&nbsp;<a href="https://onesieband.bandcamp.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://onesieband.bandcamp.com</a></p><p><br /></p>
