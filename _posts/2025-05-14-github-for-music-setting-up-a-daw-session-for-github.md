But when you download the repository, it is saved as a folder on your computer, and that downloaded folder is what will sync this session to the repository on GitHub.com.</p><p style="text-align: left;">(<b>Related post:</b>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2025/05/github-for-music-what-git-does-version.html">GitHub For Music: What Git Does - Version Control Basics</a>)</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">You need to have the same DAW setup as your collaborators</h2><p style="text-align: left;">The important thing to remember is that everybody you're collaborating with should have the same DAW setup.</p><p style="text-align: left;">That means the same version of the software that you're using, the same plugins, the same everything. Otherwise, if somebody has, for instance, a newer version of the DAW program, then when they download the repository and open the session, it's going to update the session to that newer version, and people on the older version of the software won't be able to open it any longer.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: left;">And a similar example using plugins, if you have a plugin that you're using that they don't, then it's gonna give them an error that there's a plugin missing.</p><p style="text-align: left;">That is why we use Ubuntu Studio, which is actually a Linux operating system, that's a production suite for artists and musicians. It comes pre-installed with all the programs and plug-ins we use, like the open-source DAW Ardour. So when the rest of the band members use the repository, they have all of the same software and plugins that I do.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Create a GitHub Repository and "clone" it</h2><p style="text-align: left;">To create a repository for your recording session, go to GitHub.com and click on the "New" button to create a new repository and then name it. If you don't have a GitHub account, you'll need to create one.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: left;">Now we need to clone this repository to our computer. Cloning a repository is essentially downloading the GitHub repository from the website and saving it as a folder on your desktop.&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">GitHub Desktop App</h3><p style="text-align: left;">The easiest way to clone the repository is to use the <a href="https://github.com/apps/desktop" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub desktop app</a>. The app will be a program you download to your computer that will connect to the repository and sync your changes to GitHub.com.</p><p style="text-align: left;">So once GitHub Desktop has been connected to our GitHub account and the repository has been "cloned" to the computer, we are going to continue using GitHub Desktop to manage the uploading and downloading of the changes we're gonna make in this repository.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Create a DAW session in the downloaded/cloned GitHub folder</h2><p style="text-align: left;">Now that I've cloned this repository locally onto my desktop, I can then create a brand new DAW session in this folder and start recording.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Let's say I recorded a drum part, and now I want to share it with the guitar player so he can add guitar to the track. But so far, the recording still only exists in the GitHub folder on my desktop. Nothing has been shared to the online repository yet because syncing to GitHub is not automatic; it's controlled by you.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">More later...</h2><p style="text-align: left;">So next time, I will explain <a href="https://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2025/05/github-for-music-sharing-daw-sessions.html">how I upload these DAW session changes to the GitHub.com repository</a> that I will be sharing with the guitar player.</p><div class="tomsbox"><h2 style="text-align: center;">Download My GitHub For Music Process</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-align: left;"><b>GitHub for Music Collaboration With A Full DAW Is Possible...
