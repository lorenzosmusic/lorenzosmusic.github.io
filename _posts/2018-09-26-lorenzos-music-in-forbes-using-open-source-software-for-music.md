Lorenzo's Music is featured in <b>Forbes</b> to talk about how we decided to use open source software to create and produce our release of ROM-COMM MIXTAPE. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2018/09/25/open-source-challenge-why-one-band-chose-linux-to-record-their-new-album/#740b91a34439" target="_blank">Read</a> the in-depth interview online now.<br />
<br />
Here is a small part of the interview about how the whole experiment using open source software got started.<br />

<b>Jason Evangelho:</b> Why open source software? What led you down that path?<br />
<br />
<b>Tom Ray:</b> We've been a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">creative commons</a> band for years. Anyone can use our music for videos, movies, apps and re-sample and build upon it for whatever they wanted as long as they gave us credit or attribution. So we believe in the concept of open source culture. It just made sense to create with things that have the same principles.<br />
<br />
The thought was this: musicians spend a lot of time and money on gear and instruments already and we wanted to know what could be done with open source tools as an option.<br />
<br />
It's just really cool to know that there is a community of people out there making software for musicians and artists that fall under the same ideology of sharing and availability for everyone. And it's possible to do it!<br />
