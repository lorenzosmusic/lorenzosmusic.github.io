Here are some fun facts about <a href="http://www.high-noon.com/calendar/index.php?mode=find&amp;mdy=2009&amp;mdm=10&amp;mdd=22">our show at the High Noon tonight</a>.<br />
<ol><li>Scott is in Spain. So, <b>Kevin Dunphy</b> of <a href="http://www.fevermarlene.com/">Fever Marlene</a> was kind enough to fill in for him on drums tonight.</li>
<li>Mark has injured his hand and will be playing all of his guitar parts on keyboards. And Eric (our actual keyboardist) will be on guitar from time to time.</li>

<ul><li>We practiced our set this way last night with Kevin, and it was kind of a cool take on the songs, playing them from a whole new angle. We're excited to try this out live.<br />
</li>
</ul>
<li><a href="http://melismatics.com/">The Melismatics</a> and <a href="http://shakemysoul.com/">Soul Shaker</a> are two great bands and you should come down and see us <i>all</i> perform tonight. <br />
