<b>The Hussy</b> is a band here in Madison, WI with Bobby Hussy, Heather Hussy, Tyler Fassnacht.<br />
<br />
Bobby Hussy also runs his own label <a href="https://nocoastrecordings.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">No Coast records</a>. I've wanted to meet him for some time, I reached out and asked him to be on the podcast so I could find out more about him.<br />
