<br />
So this video showed up on our feed and I was confused at first. Now don't get me wrong, I was amazed at all the crazy stuff that these guys were doing on&nbsp;Pogo-Sticks but was still wondering why this video showed up. Then about 30 seconds into it, the music changed and they were playing our song "<a href="http://lorenzosmusic.bandcamp.com/track/you-got-to-feel-it-tonight" target="_blank">You Got To Feel It Tonight</a>"!<br />
<br />
Now that's pretty cool. Suddenly I feel like my dream as a kid, to be one of the bands on the old Santa Cruz skateboard video "<a href="http://youtu.be/xK3WPeg3WxU" target="_blank">Wheels Of Fire</a>" has been&nbsp;fulfilled&nbsp;in a way.
