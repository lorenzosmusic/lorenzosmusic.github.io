I met one of the members of the band <b>The Fancy Pears</b> at an event I was at in the fall of 2018. I had never heard of his band before so I thought it would be fun to get together with them and do an interview for the podcast.<br />
<br />
Later on, I met with other members of the band and we&nbsp;just sat around a table and talked about making music. This was really why I wanted to start this show, so I could just hang out with other musicians and talk. It was a fun time.<br />
