<h3>
San Francisco - Lyrics</h3>
Tonight we talk of lost love and forgotten desires<br />
Potential buyers in the safety of my car<br />
Your dishwasher is empty<br />
His wife didn't want to pay<br />
I hope he does<br />
Yeah I hope he does too<br />
Did you say you were going to see Liz tonight?<br />
Well I talked to Jim yesterday said she's coming to town<br />
<br />
Isn't she married thought or some shit like that?<br />
She is engaged I just want to talk to her<br />
She went to school for singing or something like that?<br />
I have no idea I just want to run into her<br />
I don't know where she'd go<br />
Maybe Genna's cuz her brother's with her<br />
<br />
Tonight we talk&nbsp;of&nbsp;lost love and forgotten desires<br />
Potential buyers in the safety of my car<br />
Now, what's Jim doing in San Francisco?<br />
He might be back in January for his court date<br />
Otherwise, he's doing the same thing, took his life from Madison and moved it out there<br />
<br />
What did he say? It was something like...<br />
"I don't think the girls here like my hair"<br />
<br />
Tonight we talk&nbsp;of&nbsp;lost love and forgotten desires<br />
Potential buyers in the safety of my car<br />
Your dishwasher is empty<br />
His wife didn't want to pay<br />
I hope he does<br />
Yeah I hope he does too<br />
Did you say you were going to see Liz tonight?<br />
Well I talked to Jim yesterday said she's coming to town
