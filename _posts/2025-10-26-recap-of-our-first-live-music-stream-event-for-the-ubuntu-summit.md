This was a first-time experience for us, and thanks to the incredible performers and the essential help from <b><a href="https://ryno.cc" target="_blank">Ryno the Bearded</a></b>, we were able to pull the whole thing together.</p><p>First, thank you to everyone who participated, watched, listened, and supported the artists.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">The Performances: A Wild Combo of Open Culture</h3><p>If you missed the stream, you missed the live experience—it's over. The event highlighted the stunning diversity and creativity within the <b>creative commons</b>&nbsp;and <b>open-source</b>&nbsp;music community.</p><p>The entire thing was a wild combo of unique performances:</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><b>Lorenzo's Music:</b>&nbsp;We kicked off the showcase—our first show since opening for The Greyhounds and David Hidalgo of Los Lobos last year.</li><li><b><a href="https://crashserver.bandcamp.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Crash Server (from France):</a></b>&nbsp;A <b>live coding band</b>&nbsp;that codes music and mashes samples together on a server, all while trying to overdrive and crash the server itself.</li><li><b><a href="https://sockpuppet.band/" target="_blank">Sockpuppet:</a></b>&nbsp;A unique performer who played in a <b>VR club</b>&nbsp;with movement tracked to their own actions, making the VR avatar move.</li><li><b><a href="https://artistsynth.bandcamp.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ArtistSynth (from the Canary Islands):</a></b>&nbsp;Delivered an awesome <b>freestyle performance</b>&nbsp;by riffing on beats and patterns live inside his Bitwig DAW.</li><li><b><a href="https://makertube.net/a/gruezi_sexgott/" target="_blank">Greuzi Sexgott (from Switzerland):</a></b>&nbsp;This <b>cloud jazz band</b>&nbsp;closed out the showcase with their jazz jam style, filmed using a three-camera setup in their studio.</li></ul><p></p><p>You can and should go check out these amazing artists, support them, and download their music now!</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Support the Open Culture Mission: Two Ways to Help</h3><p>As a Creative Commons and open-source band, we use only open-source software tools to create, record, and make videos. If anything we've done over this summit gave you value, here are two simple ways you can help us continue this mission:</p><p><b>1. Subscribe to Our YouTube Channel:</b>&nbsp;It’s as simple as that, and it really helps support us. <b>Click here to subscribe</b>!</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; ➡️ Lorenzo's Music YouTube Channel: <a href="https://youtube.com/@Lorenzosmusic">youtube.com/@Lorenzosmusic</a></p><p><b>2. Join Our Crowdfunding Community:</b>&nbsp;Consider joining our <b>Ko-Fi</b>&nbsp;or <b>Mirlo</b>&nbsp;communities. These crowdfunding platforms help us cover the time it takes to create, promote this open-source music and put on free events like the CC Music Live stream.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; ➡️ <b>Support us via Mirlo:</b>&nbsp;<a href="http://mirlo.space/lorenzosmusic" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">mirlo.space/lorenzosmusic</a></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; ➡️ <b>Support us via Ko-Fi:</b>&nbsp;<a href="http://ko-fi.com/lorenzosmusic" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ko-fi.com/lorenzosmusic</a></p><p>Or you can do both! :)</p><p>We hope to see you when we try to do this event again in <b>April</b>&nbsp;with new artists, new music, and new ideas!</p><p><br /></p>
