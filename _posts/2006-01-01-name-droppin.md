In the recent issue of <a href="http://madisonmagazine.com/article.php?section_id=918&xstate=view_story&amp;story_id=212880">Madison Magazine</a> a local Madison musician named Butch Vig, who has a band called <a href="http://www.garbage.com">Garbage</a> was asked: <blockquote>"How is the music scene in Madison?"</blockquote> And he said: <blockquote>"...I like Awesome Car Funmaker, Charlemagne, and Lorenzo's Music to name a few."<br /></blockquote><br />That was a really nice thing for him to say and we hope this will help him and his band. They're actually pretty good. Check them out if you can.
