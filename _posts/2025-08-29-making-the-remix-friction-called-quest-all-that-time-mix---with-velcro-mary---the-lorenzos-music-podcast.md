Jason took on the challenge of remixing our song "Friction Called Quest" for our "<a href="https://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2025/07/lorenzos-remixes-volume-2.html">Lorenzo's Remixes, Volume 2</a>" album.<span></span></p><!--more--><p></p><p>Jason reveals how he approached the remixing process for the song. He emphasizes, "I like working with limitations," to creatively dismantle the original track, leading to a great interpretation of the song with his own style.</p><p>We talk about the technical aspects of his music production using Logic Pro. He explains how he built the drumbeat. A beat that has a swing reminiscent of classic 90s hip-hop, which Jason made by tweaking Apple’s drummer tools.</p><p>He also transformed the original structure, reworked the lyrics, and even ran the vocals through a vocoder. "I took so many liberties," he admits, showcasing his experimentation with the track.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">What we discuss</h3><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><b>Remixing Process</b>: Technical and creative process behind Velcro Mary's remix of the song "Friction Called Quest."</li><li><b>Creative Constraints</b>: Challenges Jason faced while creating the remix.</li><li><b>Music Production</b>: The philosophical approach to Jason's remixing</li><li><b>Logic Pro</b>: The specific software he used for the remix.</li></ul><p></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Key Takeaways</h3><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li><b>Chopping up the original song</b>: Jason took significant liberties with the original song, changing the structure, chopping up lyrics, and retuning melodies.</li><li><b>Tom Ray praised the remix's unique beat</b>: Says it has a 1920s/1930s swing to it.
