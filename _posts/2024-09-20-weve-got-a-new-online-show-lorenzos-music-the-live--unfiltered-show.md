Every week, we live stream our band practice from the studio. But this isn't your typical rehearsal—we've set up multiple cameras around our studio to show everything that's going on. Each episode features us playing a few songs from our setlist, along with a special segment where we either improvise a new song or work on one of our latest songs that we've never played live!</p><p>It's not just about the music—we chat, joke around, and go off on tangents. And the best part? If you are watching the show you can join us in the live chat! Feel free to interact, ask questions, or just hang out with us as we go through our practice.</p><p>We broadcast the show live every Wednesday night at 10 PM Central Time on our YouTube channel. Can't make the live stream? No worries—replays are available afterward so you can catch up anytime.</p><p>Check it out, subscribe to our YouTube channel, and hit the bell icon to get notified when we go live. We'd love to see you there!</p><p>Check it out on YouTube and <b>remember to subscribe to the channel!</b></p><p>Watch - <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbvJrJ34c9Mmx4NdEKeYHSUJsVbO-gJvg&amp;si=4m18Z3iVx_0nsydZ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Lorenzo's Music: The Live &amp; Unfiltered Show on YouTube</a></p>
