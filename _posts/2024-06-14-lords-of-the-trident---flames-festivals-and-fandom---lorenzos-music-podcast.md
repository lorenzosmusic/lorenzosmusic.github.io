Known as the most metal band on earth who blend performances with theatrical elements that include fire, costumes, and even swords!<span></span></p><!--more--><p></p><p>We dive deep into the origins of the band, which hails from Madison, Wisconsin. Ty shares how a simple fascination with the hilarity of a Manowar DVD led to the creation of a band that not only embraces but also amplifies the theatrical aspects of metal music. With influences like Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, and Dio.</p><p>One of the standout topics in our conversation is the band’s use of Patreon. Ty explains how they started their Patreon years ago as a way to fund their projects, including music videos, tours, and even their own festival, Mad with Power Fest. This annual two-day event is North America's largest arcade, pinball, and heavy metal festival, featuring bands from all over the world and a plethora of free-play arcade and pinball games.</p><p>Ty also shares how the band has managed to grow their Patreon to become their primary economic driver. By offering exclusive content, early access to albums, and unique merchandise like limited-edition T-shirts and pins, they’ve created a loyal fanbase that supports them month after month. This steady income has allowed them to plan big projects, like touring Japan and producing high-quality music videos.</p><p>We also talk about Ty's recent collaboration with the Sonic Symphony performing Sonic the Hedgehog music in New York.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Links</h2><p>Lords of the Trident Website - <a href="https://www.lordsofthetrident.com" target="_blank">https://www.lordsofthetrident.com</a></p><p>Lords of the Trident YouTube - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/lordsofthetrident" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/lordsofthetrident</a></p><p>Lords of the Trident Patreon - <a href="https://www.patreon.com/lordsofthetrident" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.patreon.com/lordsofthetrident</a></p><p><br /></p>
