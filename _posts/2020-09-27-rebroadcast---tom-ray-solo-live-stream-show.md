I was curious if I even knew how to play our live set anymore.&nbsp;</p><p>So I went out to our practice space hooked my computer up to the sound system and used the bands recorded tracks from our <a href="https://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2018/08/rom-comm-mixtape.html">Rom-Comm Mixtape</a> and played along with them.</p><p><b>The songs I did were:</b></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Astronaut</li><li>Why did I</li><li>Go on for miles</li><li>Where did it go</li><li>La la la song</li></ol><p>I thought to myself, this is what I would be doing if the band was in the same room anyway, why not try it as a live stream?</p><p>-Tom</p><p><br /></p>
