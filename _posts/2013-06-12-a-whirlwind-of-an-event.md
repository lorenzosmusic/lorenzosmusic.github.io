<br />
The week before our June 1st show in <a href="http://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2013/05/our-friend-something-i-never-thought-id.html">honor of our friend Paulie Heenan</a> was and emotional and rewarding experience. This Photo above is from the tribute set we did at the end of the night with some of his friends/musicians performing unheard songs he had written before his passing.<br />
<br />
<!--more-->We love him and miss him and feel this really honored the way he should be remembered.<br />
<br />
There was live video and audio recorded of all that bands that had performed and I know that they all hope to release these soon.<br />
<br />
We got our hands on a recording of our song <i>"Fervor"</i>&nbsp;that we have always felt was much better as a live song compared to the <a href="http://lorenzosmusic.bandcamp.com/track/fervor" target="_blank">studio recording</a>.<br />
