<br />
<blockquote>"This song will get stuck in my head for days on end, but that’s not such a bad thing in this case. &nbsp;I’m Doing Fine is off the album Solamente Tres Palabras which translates to Only Three Words. &nbsp;You can thank my 7th grade Spanish teacher Senora McCoy for that bit of trivia. &nbsp;Oddly enough, every song on the album has only three words in the title. &nbsp;It kind of reminds me of Trashman’s Shoes by Shoulders, but just a tad less drunken carnival like. &nbsp;It’s definitely my favorite tune on the album, but you should check them all out anyway. &nbsp;I mean, it’s free."</blockquote><a href="http://www.musicblur.com/?p=560">http://www.musicblur.com/?p=560</a><br />

The blog mainly posts music videos but as he says on his site, he didn't want to have to wait for a video and put our song up anyway.<br />

Thanks James!
