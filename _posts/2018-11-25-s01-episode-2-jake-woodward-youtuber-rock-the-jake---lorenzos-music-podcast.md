I wanted to talk to people that have signed up to our mailing list or people that have used our music for their own projects or just people that I’ve heard about on the internet that seemed like they were doing interesting things. Things that I wanted to know more about.<br />
<br />
The person I’m talking to today Jake Woodward is a YouTuber that makes videos and music.<br />
<br />
Jake is one of the people that contacted me from our email list. How he heard about us in the first place is actually kind of a funny story.<br />
