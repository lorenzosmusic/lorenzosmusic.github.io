<br />
This is a funny story that I had forgotten all about, until recently.<br />
<br />
<b>Years ago</b><br />
Our old guitarist <b>Evan Gruzis</b> came practice and told us a story.<br />
The night before he was outside of a bar at the end of the night and a film crew was following comedian <b>David Cross</b> around on the street.<br />
<br />
He told us they just started walking up to people asking random questions.<br />
Evan said that they were giving him and his friend a hard time. He got annoyed and told them something like, "I suppose I should just start doing a dance for you to entertain you" or something like that. The whole thing sounded very odd.<br />
<br />
I had forgotten all about this story.<br />
<br />
<b>Fast forward to now:</b><br />
I had just finished watching the new season of <b>Arrested Development</b> on <b>Netflix</b> and one of the suggestions to watch next was the David Cross special <b>"Let America Laugh"</b>.<br />
<br />
So I figured I'd watch it.<br />
<br />
About <b>48 minutes</b> into it, they did a montage of drunk people on the street and that's when Evan appeared on the screen (pictured above, circled in yellow).<br />
Then I remembered the story he had told me. So that was entertaining to see.<br />
<br />
<b>One weird side-note&nbsp;</b><br />
The closing joke David gives at the end of the special is about a new restaurant at the time called <b>Cosi</b> and their introduction of the square bagel called <i>"The Squagel"</i>.<br />
<br />
I realized that in the picture above, the bar in our city that Even is pictured in front of, <b>Stillwaters</b>, is no longer there. It's now a <b>Cosi restaurant</b>.<br />
