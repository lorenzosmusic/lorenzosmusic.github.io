<br />
Our music gets used in a lot of skateboarding and bike videos, even once in a <a href="http://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2012/04/crazy-pogopalooza-8-video-using-our.html" target="">pogo competition</a>.<br />
<br />
But I do have to say I enjoy the wipe-out ones the most. Just try and watch this without just shouting out when someone goes down!<br />
<br />
