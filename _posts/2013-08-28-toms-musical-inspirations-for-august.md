While mark and I were discussing the direction of a song we're working on, I sighted a list of songs that have been in heavy rotation on my Google All Access playlist.<br />

<div>
I went and found them on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/lorenzosmusic" target="_blank">YouTube</a> for him and thought I'd share it here.</div>

<br /></div>

Some of them I picked the live versions because I loved the way they pulled them off for a crowd. Have a listen and enjoy.<br />
