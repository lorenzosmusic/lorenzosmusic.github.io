<p>We've been doing live streams of our songwriting sessions at our studio from our <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/lorenzosmusic" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Twitch channel</a>. We just turn on the camera and try out ideas and see where they take us each week.</p><p>We took a clip from one of those sessions that we liked recently and posted it on our <a href="https://youtube.com/lorenzosmusic" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>.</p><p>We gave this song idea a random name called <i>"Slippery Friction"</i> and decided to build on it.<span></span></p><!--more--><p></p><p>Here is the progress so far...</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">1. Slippery Friction Clav Sound (Live Stream Clip)</h2><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" class="BLOG_video_class" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eaNzM7iCoKw" width="320" youtube-src-id="eaNzM7iCoKw"></iframe></div><p>It was Tom playing a part on the keys using the clav sound, Cliff played bass and Rob just started doing a beat.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">2. Slippery friction loop - clav &amp; bass</h2><p>We liked this little snippet of an idea from the live session and decided to try and build on it.</p><p>We've started posting the progress of what it's become since then as YouTube shorts.</p><p>The first one is the main idea with the clav keys and bass</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" class="BLOG_video_class" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pqg_N5GuSTI" width="320" youtube-src-id="Pqg_N5GuSTI"></iframe></div><h2 style="text-align: left;">3. Slippery friction loop - clav and bass with a beat</h2><p>Then added a beat to it.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" class="BLOG_video_class" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z0zNLVfzxuo" width="320" youtube-src-id="Z0zNLVfzxuo"></iframe></div><h2 style="text-align: left;">4. Slippery friction loop - variations on the theme</h2><p>After doing all this we recorded the other part that came up during the live session video. The song broke up a bit from the main theme and had a more sparse groove.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" class="BLOG_video_class" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6JLydj2dcPY" width="320" youtube-src-id="6JLydj2dcPY"></iframe></div><p>That's what has come from this session so far.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Follow live shows on Twitch</h2><p>By the way, if you would like to watch while we do these live songwriting sessions you can follow our Twitch channel.</p><p><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/lorenzosmusic" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.twitch.tv/lorenzosmusic</a></p><p><br /></p>
