{% include video-embed.html video_id="videoseries" title="Astronaut: Song Inspiration Playlist" %}<br />
I was watching the documentary <b>Hip Hop Evolution</b> and one of the things I thought was really cool was how people were building songs off of a sample they found. Hunting down old records to find something that might inspire their next idea hidden in one of the tracks.<br />
<br />
I realized that we <i>kinda</i> do the same thing?<br />
<br />
When we're working on a song, ideas and examples get mentioned or referenced as we try to figure out what the song should do. Things like a style, a type of sound or structure of a song. Stuff like that.<br />
<br />
I've got in the habit of adding these songs to a playlist so we don't forget.<br />
<br />
After watching that documentary I looked back at those playlists and thought, it actually makes quite a unique little mix to listen to on its own.<br />
<br />
So I thought I'd start sharing some of the obscure music that we saved while writing each song.<br />
