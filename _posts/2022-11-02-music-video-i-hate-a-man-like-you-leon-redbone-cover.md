It's a dark piece on the album with just a guitar and him singing in his unique voice. It's been one of my favorite songs for years.</p><p>But it's actually a cover of a song he did that was originally written and performed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jelly_Roll_Morton" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Jelly Roll Morton</a> on the piano in 1930.</p><p><br /></p>
