<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kz1J3M_aw-w" frameborder="0"></iframe></p><p>This clip is from a full live stream performance I did on <a href="https://youtu.be/dxdaqD6PQzAe" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">our YouTube channel</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>This one is called "La la la song" which is kind of self-explanatory when you hear it.</p><p>We used to have a baritone sax player in the band and this song was screaming for baritone sax and luckily I had one on the keyboard I use. It's not the same by any means but I love playing that part.</p><p>Along with that part, this song also is the first one on our <a href="https://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2018/08/rom-comm-mixtape.html">Rom-Comm Mixtape</a> release where I actually utilize the two mics that I have.&nbsp;</p><p>All of the songs on that mixtape up until now I only used a <b>bullet harmonica microphone for vocals</b>. In this one, I also have a regular <b>58 microphone</b> that I switch between to for different voicings.&nbsp;</p><p>The vocals on this song have two different sounds for it because of that. It's kind of a way to get around having a megaphone to use. Although it would be fun to have a megaphone.&nbsp;</p><p>You can view the whole live stream performance on YouTube <a href="https://youtu.be/dxdaqD6PQzAe" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/dxdaqD6PQzAe</a></p>
