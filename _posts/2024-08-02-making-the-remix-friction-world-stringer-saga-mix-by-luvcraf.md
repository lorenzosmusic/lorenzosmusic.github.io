He emphasized the importance of not holding anything too precious, often stripping away the most distinctive elements of a track to rebuild it from the ground up. Inspired by artists like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PJ_Harvey" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PJ Harvey</a>, he believes that removing your favorite part of a song can lead to unexpected new directions.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Remix Inspiration &amp; Tools</h2><p>When it comes to vocals, Daniel employs a technique using auto-tune not to correct pitch, but to create glitch effects by running vocals through an EQ and using a vocal bender to pitch them up an octave.</p><p>For drum sounds he draws inspiration from bands like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flaming_Lips" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Flaming Lips</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocteau_Twins" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Cocteau Twins</a>, he aims for big, reverberating drum sounds. He shared his process of using different drum machines and synthesizers to achieve the desired effect, including the <a href="https://amzn.to/3Szc3pj" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Boss Dr-880</a> and the <a href="https://amzn.to/3WOjefQ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Roland SP-404</a>.</p><p>He described how he uses the Mellotron and various string synthesizers to replace existing elements in a track and his love for psychedelic music when remixing.</p><p>On the guitar side, he uses the <a href="https://amzn.to/4fxdwWL" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">EarthQuaker Devices' Night Wire pedal</a> which has an interesting delay feature.</p><p>It was really cool to learn about Daniel's process to create this remix for the album!</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Listen to it here</h2><p>Listen to the song on our album <a href="https://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2024/07/lorenzos-remixes-volume-1.html">"Lorenzo's Remixes, Volume 1"</a> from the blocSonic label</p>
