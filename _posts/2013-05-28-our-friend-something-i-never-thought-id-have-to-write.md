<br />
This photo was taken after a show we did back in October by our friend <b>Paulie Heenan</b>, who was running sound for us. After that night, I never saw him again. He was <a href="http://www.channel3000.com/news/Officer-involved-in-shooting-has-history-of-controversy/-/1648/17357042/-/m7fc0s/-/index.html" target="_blank">shot and killed by local police a few nights later</a>.<br />

He had recently moved back to town after living in New York for several years. I was looking forward to getting&nbsp;acquainted&nbsp;with him again. He was a great musician and guitar player.<br />
<br />
The story behind what really happened that night will always be a mystery.<br />
It should have only been a crazy story that he would tell us about the next day.<br />
<br />
Paulie was a friend to all of us. Before Lorenzo's Music, he and our bassist Cliff used to play together in the band <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monovox" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank" title="Monovox">Monovox</a> and toured the country.<br />
<br />
Every day we remember him and why we miss him so.<br />
