<p>We've been doing live streams of our songwriting sessions from our studio on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/lorenzosmusic" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">our Twitch channel</a>. We just turn on the camera and try out ideas and see where they take us.</p><p>Here is a clip from one of those sessions we posted to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRghTj3ajY6YjV6_obPT2Jw?sub_confirmation=1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">our YouTube Channel</a>.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Trying to write a theatrical bridge part (Live Stream Clip)</h2><p><iframe frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4TCYJc9v_0s" type="text/html" width="640"></iframe></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">It needs something?<span><!--more--></span></h2><p>We have a theme song that we've been working on for a film. After arranging the song it still needed something. Something in between the verse and chorus that was way different than what was going on in the song.</p><p>Cliff, Rob, and I were in the studio doing a live stream and I thought we could try and test out some ideas.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Just try something</h2><p>The last time we tried an idea for this song I said "<a href="https://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2022/08/try-it-looney-tunes-style-live-stream.html">What if we did Looney Tunes style?</a>"</p><p>This time around I wanted to see what would happen if I said make a theatrical change.</p><p>Rob got behind the other keyboard we had in the room and I tried to do something more melodic on my keyboard. And Cliff tried out different ideas on the bass.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Still not there</h2><p>We knew it wasn't going to be exactly what we needed. But playing it live on the video stream made us have to think on our feet and try something different.</p><p>-Tom</p><div class="tomsbox"><h2 style="text-align: left;">Don't Forget!</h2><p>If you want to see more clips in the future, subscribe to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRghTj3ajY6YjV6_obPT2Jw?sub_confirmation=1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">our YouTube Channel</a>!</p><p>If you would like to watch our live streams follow us on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/lorenzosmusic" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">our Twitch Channel</a>!</p></div><p><br /></p>
