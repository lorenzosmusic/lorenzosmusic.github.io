What has to be one of the strangest videos using our music to date, I found this fan video on YouTube by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/TheBardofNC" target="_blank">TheBardofNC</a>.<br />
He says it's a "piece [he] did for a pacing assignment in TV Production class."<br />
<br />
While our song "<a href="http://lorenzosmusic.bandcamp.com/track/just-had-to-let-you-know">Just had to let you know</a>" plays in the background he passes the night, drinking, watching tv and of course declares his love for a stuffed animal?<br />
