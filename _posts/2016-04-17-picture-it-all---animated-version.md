<h3>An animation student from Korea made a music video of us for a school project.</h3><p style="text-align: left;"><b>Watch the video on YouTube</b> -&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/GoUBE653OGs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/GoUBE653OGs</a></p>
A few months back we were contacted by a student from the <b>Korea Animation High School</b>.<br />
<br />
In the email, it said they were inspired by our song&nbsp;<b>"Hot Water Avalanche"</b>&nbsp;from the album <a href="http://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2006/01/solamente-tres-palabras.html">Solamente Tres Palabras</a>&nbsp;and asked&nbsp;if they could make an animated video of our song <a href="http://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2013/09/picture-it-all.html">"Picture it all"</a>.<br />
<br />
They told us they were going to make the video as a project for school using a <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotoscoping" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank" title="Rotoscoping">rotoscoping</a> technique where animators trace over live footage, frame by frame, for animated films.<br />
<br />
They asked us if this was ok? Since our music is licensed under <a class="zem_slink" href="http://creativecommons.org/" rel="homepage" target="_blank" title="Creative Commons">Creative Commons</a>&nbsp;I told them they didn't even need to ask and it sounded pretty cool. Said to them that would be great!<br />
<br />
I said to let us know when they finished because we would love to see it.<br />
<br />
Months passed and I had kind of forgotten all about it.<br />
<br />
Then I woke up one morning and there was an email from a name I sort of recognized. It was the student in Korea.<br />
<br />
They had finished the project and sent us a link.<br />
<br />
It was amazing! We were so floored by this we wanted to share it with you.<br />
