So we started expanding on it and multi-tracking it.<span></span></p><!--more--><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Slippery Friction with Drum Samples Session</h2><div>Here is the song arrangement so far that you can listen to.&nbsp;</div><p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="30" mozallowfullscreen="true" src="https://archive.org/embed/slippery-friction-w-drums_r2_session_210728" webkitallowfullscreen="true" width="500"></iframe></p><p>We tentatively called it <b>Slippery Friction</b> just because it needed a name. I asked what we should call it when I created the file for the recording session and Rob just said "Slippery Friction."&nbsp;</p><p>So I was like "Okay?"</p><p>(<b>You can watch the original live stream video here</b> - <a href="https://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2022/02/live-streams-turning-into-song-ideas.html">LIVE STREAMS TURNING INTO SONG IDEAS - SLIPPERY FRICTION</a>)</p><p>Here is what we did in this version.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Added bass guitar</h2><p>We shared this recording session in a <a href="https://github.com/lorenzosmusic/slippery-friction" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub Repository</a>. Cliff had recently arranged the clav keys of the two different parts I recorded into a song structure from that.&nbsp;</p><p>Then he tracked multiple potential bass parts.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Searching for a beat loop</h2><p>After Cliff had done that, I wanted to spend some time with it to see what else the song could do. And one thing I wanted to try was finding a beat to loop. Something random to see what it would do to the song.</p><p>So I headed over to <a href="https://freesound.org" target="_blank">freesound.org</a> to look for something that was at the same <b>86 BPM tempo</b>. I found a few and ended up using two of them.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Beat loops I used</h3><p><b>hats_peace.wav</b> - <a href="https://freesound.org/people/c.void/sounds/491327/" target="_blank">https://freesound.org/people/c.void/sounds/491327/</a></p><p><b>Scratched Beats 009</b> - <a href="https://freesound.org/people/GioMilko/sounds/380887/" target="_blank">https://freesound.org/people/GioMilko/sounds/380887/</a></p><p>I messed with these loops a bit in the <a href="https://ardour.org/" target="_blank">Ardour DAW</a> and ended up EQing the crap out of them.&nbsp;</p><p>I also had to edit the "scratched beats 009" loop a bit because it actually wasn't on time with 86 BPM as it was labeled. It was just a bit off.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Needs more of course</h2><p>And that is where the song is at so far.</p><p>I think it needs <a href="https://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2022/08/progress-on-song-slippery-friction-added-guitars.html">a guitar line next</a>.</p><p>-Tom</p><div class="tomsbox"><h2 style="text-align: left;">Don't Forget!</h2><p>Want to see more live stream clips and videos?
