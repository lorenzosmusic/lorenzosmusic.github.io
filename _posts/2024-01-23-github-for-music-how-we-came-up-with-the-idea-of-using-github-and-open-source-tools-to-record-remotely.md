Could the band use this to share full recording DAW sessions with each other to collaborate on songs remotely?</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Couldn't find anyone else that was doing this.</h3><p>I searched and searched online and <b>I couldn't find any other band that was doing this.</b> So I wasn't sure if it was possible.</p><p>I looked at one of our recording sessions in <a href="https://ardour.org/" target="_blank">Ardour (the open-source DAW we use)</a>. It had separate folders for all the contents the software used like a folder for the audio recordings.</p><p>And if I searched for the Ardour file that opens the session in the software, and right-clicked on it to open it in a text doc -- It was just an XML file.</p><p>It was just code.</p><p>So I thought, that should work right?</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">The Experiment:</h2><h3 style="text-align: left;">Testing a song idea with GitHub and Ardour DAW for the first time.</h3><p>I decided to try out the idea with a new Ardour session. At my home, I recorded a keyboard idea for a song. That way at least if it didn't work I didn't lose a song we were already working on.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Uploading the session to GitHub.</h3><p>After I saved the session and closed it. I created a new repository for it on GitHub and uploaded the entire Ardour session folder to GitHub.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Accessing the session on a different laptop at the studio.</h3><p>So here was the first big test.</p><p>Later at our studio, I cloned the GitHub repository to the laptop we use out there. I opened the session and everything was there!</p><p>So far everything was working just great!</p><p>Next, I created a new branch in the repository so we could record new parts for the song. Then when we were done I saved the session and uploaded the new changes on this branch to the GitHub repository.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Here's the real secret to using GitHub for music collaboration</h2><p></p><blockquote><p>Our bass player Cliff said something that changed the whole thing...</p><p>He said, "Why would we have to merge it?"</p></blockquote><p></p><p>After the recording session, I described the whole process of what I was trying out to the band. I told them my main concern was what was going to happen when I tried to merge this new branch with the main branch.</p><p>I worried that If there was a conflict during the merge of the two branches there was no way to fix it.</p><p>That's when our bass player Cliff said something that changed the whole thing...</p><p>He said, <i>"Why would we have to merge it?"</i></p><p>He was right! We weren't writing code, we were creating music.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Branches = Song changes</h3><p>So we started using GitHub as a way to track the timeline of a song not maintaining a main branch. Each new branch is a new iteration of that song.</p><p>So the next time we wanted to make changes to a song we just created a new branch from the previous branch and so on until the song was done!</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">When the song is done</h2><p>And when the song was done. We would make a new <i>"Final-mix"</i> branch and make that the main branch in the GitHub repository.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Collaborative Power</h2><p>We were actually able to record and mix several songs because of this method during the global shutdown in 2020.</p><p>The other members of the band could now contribute remotely by adding new parts, and effects, and mixing songs from home.</p><p>And even today it brings flexibility to the creative process for us, allowing ideas to flourish outside the confines of our studio.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">The Technical Setup:</h2><p>As far as our technical setup, we use <a href="https://ubuntustudio.org/" target="_blank">Ubuntu Studio, a creative operating suite for musicians</a> so all band members have the same software tools and effects installed by default.</p><p>We haven't tested it with other recording software but in theory, this could be done with other DAW setups.</p><p>However, I encourage other musicians to explore the possibilities of using open-source tools and version control for their projects.</p><p>You can even <a href="https://ubuntustudio.org/download/" target="_blank">create a bootable USB version of Ubuntu Studio</a> to try it out yourself without having to install the operating system on your computer.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Conclusion:</h2><p>We continue to <a href="https://www.lorenzosmusic.com/search/label/music">work on new songs</a> combining traditional recording with remote collaboration using GitHub.</p><p>The freedom and creativity of experimenting with open-source tools have brought a lot to the band.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Have a question about this?</h2><p>If you would like to ask more about this process you can send us a message</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><a href="mailto:tom@lorenzosmusic.com">tom@lorenzosmusic.com</a></li><li><a href="https://instagram.com/lorenzosmusic" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Instagram</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/lorenzosmusic" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">X</a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.com/lorenzosmusic" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Facebook</a></li><li><a href="https://mastodon.social/@lorenzosmusic" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mastodon</a></li></ul><p></p><p><br /></p>
