<h3 style="text-align: left;">Animated more scenes for our version of "Shore Leave" in Blender Grease Pencil</h3><p>I had mentioned in <a href="https://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2021/09/i-started-with-simple-beat-and-it.html">a previous video</a> that I got the idea to turn the song we're working on "Shore Leave" by <b>Tom Waits</b> into video shorts.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm drawing them and releasing them as I go using the free animation software <a href="https://www.blender.org/" target="_blank">Blender</a>.</p><p>Previously, I had finished <a href="https://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2021/09/first-2-scenes-animated-for-shore-leave.html">scenes 1 and 2</a>.</p><p>This time I have a collection of scenes <b>3 through 7</b> done.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">{% include video-embed.html video_id="T9DFAx_noSM" title="5 more music video scenes animated - Shore Leave" %}</div><h2 style="text-align: left;">Scene 3</h2><h3 style="text-align: left;">"A shore leave wristwatch beneath my sleeve"</h3><p>The camera has zoomed in on the pencil sketch man as he continues to sing the song into a payphone motioning to the person on the other end.</p><p><br /></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">{% include video-embed.html video_id="LeXRjT8TaVM" title="5 more music video scenes animated - Shore Leave" %}</div><h2 style="text-align: left;">Scene 4</h2><h3 style="text-align: left;">"I rolled down the gutter to the blood bank"</h3><p>Pencil sketch man starts to get more comfortable singing into the phone and his arms accent the rhythm of what he's saying as he looks into the phone.</p><p>(<b>Related post</b> - <a href="https://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2021/09/progress-on-animating-our-shore-leave.html">How I animated these videos in Blender Grease Pencil</a>)</p><p><br /></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">{% include video-embed.html video_id="vOnN_HgdE1E" title="5 more music video scenes animated - Shore Leave" %}</div><h2 style="text-align: left;">Scene 5</h2><h3 style="text-align: left;">"I was in bad need of a shave"</h3><p>A slight bounce while talking before grabbing the phone with both hands.</p><p><br /></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">{% include video-embed.html video_id="CDSL1rLenx4" title="5 more music video scenes animated - Shore Leave" %}</div><h2 style="text-align: left;">Scene 6</h2><h3 style="text-align: left;">"I slopped on the corner on cold chow mein"</h3><p>The arms continue to shift up and down while still holding the phone with both hands.</p><p><br /></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">{% include video-embed.html video_id="1uFUabwt2Q4" title="5 more music video scenes animated - Shore Leave" %}</div><h2 style="text-align: left;">Scene 7</h2><h3 style="text-align: left;">"I bought a long sleeve shirt with some horses on the front"</h3><p>In this scene, I did a long pan of pencil sketch man's body from the feet up to his face. This is what happens during this part in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Time_(1988_film)" target="_blank">Tom Waits movie "Big Time"</a>. So I was trying to stay true to that.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">More on the way!</h2><p>I've got more scenes for this music video on the way. I started this because I've always wanted to record this song in Lorenzo's Music style. Also, I've wanted to learn how to use Blender for a long time so it was a way to do both!</p><p><b>If you missed the first two animations for this song</b> -&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2021/09/first-2-scenes-animated-for-shore-leave.html">FIRST 2 SCENES ANIMATED FOR SHORE LEAVE VIDEO</a></p><p>-Tom</p>
