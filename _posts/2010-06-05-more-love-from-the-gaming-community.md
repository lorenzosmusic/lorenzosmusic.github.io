<a href="http://virtualflicks.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=355:royalty-free-music&amp;catid=1:latest-news">virtualflicks.net</a>&nbsp;is a website about games, how to make them and play them and any other thing you can think of. In the resources section they list- how to's, voice talent and music available for game creators. Turns out that WE are one of their choices!<br />
In the <a href="http://virtualflicks.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=section&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=15&amp;Itemid=430">music section</a> they've listed us for consideration if you're looking for music on a project. On the post we're listed below Charles Manson's album but I would have been surprised if we weren't.<br />
Thanks to <i>NightmareProductions</i> for the post.<br />
