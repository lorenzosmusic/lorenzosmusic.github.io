{% include video-embed.html video_id="VwyBWqt9ZPs" title="Making of Friction world (Behind the scenes)" %}<p>Listen to our song <a href="https://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2025/04/friction-album.html">"Friction world" from our album Friction</a>!</p><p>This is a behind-the-scenes look at the making of our song <b>Friction world</b>. The song is part of a movie soundtrack called "Friction".</p><!--more--><p></p><p>We talk about how we are transforming a simple loop called 'Slippery Friction' into a full-blown soundtrack. We show how we utilized <b>Ubuntu Studio</b>, <b>Ardour</b>, and <b>GitHub</b> to collaborate remotely and create a diverse array of musical styles that led to an opportunity to score a Creative Commons film.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Soundcards we use in our studio setup:</h2><p style="text-align: left;"></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Behringer U-PHORIA UMC1820 - <a href="https://amzn.to/3RKfPwe">https://amzn.to/3RKfPwe</a></li><li>Behringer ADA8200 Microphone Preamp - <a href="https://amzn.to/46tGGRq">https://amzn.to/46tGGRq</a></li></ul><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">We came up with a method to record music remotely</h2><p>During the pandemic, we came up with a way to record music remotely using <a href="https://ubuntustudio.org/" target="_blank">Ubuntu Studio</a> as our production suite, <a href="https://ardour.org/" target="_blank">Ardour</a> as our recording DAW, and <a href="https://github.com/lorenzosmusic" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a> to share these full sessions and recordings with each other online through this sharing service.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">We started out sharing music loop ideas with each other</h2><p>We started out testing this idea by creating loops, and each one of these loops was based on one song idea, called "<a href="https://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2023/09/slippery-friction-by-lorenzos-music.html">Slippery friction</a>" and each loop we created from that original loop was in a different musical style that we would share with each other.</p><p>So by the end of this whole session, testing loops and sharing them with each other and collaborating online, we had 14 different music loops that were all in completely different styles.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">We got the opportunity to turn our song loop ideas into a movie soundtrack</h2><p>And while we were working on that song, we got an opportunity to make music for a film soundtrack. And that's when we realized that these different themed loops that we had all in different music genres would be perfect for this film project.</p><p><a href="https://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2025/04/friction-album.html"><b>Listen to the album "Friction" here!</b></a> ☚</p>
