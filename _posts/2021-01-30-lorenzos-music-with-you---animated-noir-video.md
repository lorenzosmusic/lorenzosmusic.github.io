I was drawing things in the style of old black and white mystery monster movies and comics.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: left;">Later I turned those sketches into animated gifs. Then the gifs were put together into a sequence for a video story. A throwback to the feel of a Liquid Television short animation.</p><p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://bit.ly/3avDPOh" target="_blank">Get this song from our Bandcamp page!</a></p>
