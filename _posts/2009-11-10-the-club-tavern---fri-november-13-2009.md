<br />
The night will begin with <b>Tax Brandywine</b> from <i>Indianapolis</i>. They have just completed their  first EP under the <em>Tax Brandywine</em> banner entitled “From here to Navy Pier…”. Duncan’s soul-filled intertwining harmonies and rocking guitar solos are reminiscent of the classic sounds of Eric Clapton, Steve Winwood, and The Beatles.<br />
Hear songs from the album on their <a href="http://www.taxbrandywine.com/Music.html">website</a>.<br />
<br />
Next up is <b>The Nod</b>. If you haven't heard of them here's what Channel3000.com had to say:<br />
<blockquote><span style="font-size: x-small;"><i>Taking its musical cues from bands like Weezer and Cake, the Nod use frontman Brett Newski and Cousin Martin's guitar playing as the abrasive edge to their pop ditties.</i></span><br />
