What made it interesting was that all the songs for the soundtrack were based on just one simple set of chords.&nbsp;</p><p>And back in 2021 Rob and I tried out those chords for the first time on one of those streaming sessions. (It was right after quarantine as you can tell by Rob's beard 😁)</p><p>Now, I'm considering revisiting that moment—literally. I’m thinking about downloading the video and sampling the actual live stream audio in our next song. Raw. Unedited. Exactly as it happened.</p><p>It’s like capturing the creative spark in its purest form.</p><p>Curious to see how it all began?</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">You can watch a clip of that stream here</h2><p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IyKTJk9oDL8?si=qnz8zjTe2UoKDInk&amp;clip=UgkxsxXLoELJw2xDYtiYfWZ1HxZpzImH1AYi&amp;clipt=EJyVARjAuAI" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></p><p><br /></p>
