{% include video-embed.html video_id="O34ntqmkvrs" title="Why did I - Tom Ray Live Stream Solo performance." %}<p>This a clip from a <a href="https://youtu.be/dxdaqD6PQzA" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">full live stream performance I did on our YouTube channel</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>This clip is of our song called "Why did I" and I have an organ part on this one that I use a sound called a "Purple organ". I'm assuming it's supposed to sound like purple rain but I like the way it sounds with the song.&nbsp;</p><p>so this one is on our release <a href="https://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2018/08/rom-comm-mixtape.html" rel="" target="">Rom-Comm Mixtape</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>We also have <a href="https://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2018/09/why-did-i-music-video.html">a music video for this one</a>. it is a video that was by a great filmmaker for a short film on Vimeo called "Chance". It was under the same creative commons license that we use so it was cut up to use for this song.&nbsp;</p><p>Here's a weird thing I feel like the girl in the video looks a lot like the girl from "Stranger things". I don't know if it's the same girl or not but I feel like they look similar.&nbsp;</p><p>The concept of the video is it's two kids driving around and then they blow up a car. I thought it was really cool so we used it!</p><p>You can watch the full live stream performance on YouTube&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/dxdaqD6PQzA" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/dxdaqD6PQzA</a></p><p>- Tom</p>
