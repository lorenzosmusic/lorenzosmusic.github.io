I was happy to see our song "<a href="http://lorenzosmusic.bandcamp.com/track/we-all-fall-down" target="_blank">We all fall down</a>" being used in this video&nbsp;of climber <b>Dave MacLeod</b> on Vimeo. Then saw that it was also mentioned in a post on the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-18074424" target="_blank">BBC News website</a>!<br />
<br />
Feel like I should make a 2 birds/1 STONE pun here. <i>*rimshot*</i><br />

</i> Not sure if the song is going to be part of the short film he will be showing around Mountain festivals but if he does that will be <a href="http://blog.lorenzosmusic.com/2012/06/got-screener-for-new-movie-using-our.html" target="_blank">2 festival films</a> we've been <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2067001/maindetails" target="_blank">involved in this year</a>!<br />
