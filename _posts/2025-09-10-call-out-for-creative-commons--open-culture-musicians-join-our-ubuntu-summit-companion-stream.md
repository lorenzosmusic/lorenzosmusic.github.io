<h3 style="text-align: left;">Are you a Creative Commons, Open Source, or Fedi musician or band? Do you make live streams of your music? Consider being part of our online event!</h3><p>Hey There!&nbsp;</p><p>This year's <a href="https://ubuntu.com/summit" target="_blank">Ubuntu Summit</a> is just around the corner; this time around it's happening online on <b>October 23rd and 24th</b>. It's a fantastic global open-source community to connect, learn, and share ideas.</p><p>This year, I wanted to add an extra layer of creativity and collaboration to the experience. Inspired by the spirit of open source and free culture, I'm thrilled to announce I am actively working to set up a <b>companion music live stream event</b> dedicated to showcasing <b>Creative Commons and Open Culture musicians and bands!</b></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">What's the Idea?</h3><p>I'm thinking of it as a live, online music festival running alongside the Ubuntu Summit – a space where technology meets art, and open licenses and culture. My plan is to host a dynamic music performance stream featuring artists who release their music under Creative Commons licenses or are deeply rooted in the open culture movement.</p><p>Each participating artist or band will get a 20-minute slot to perform a live set on our streaming platform. Depending on the number of submissions, we'll build a full schedule that celebrates the diversity and innovation within the open music world. Think of it as a virtual stage where your music can reach a passionate open-source audience connected by shared values.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Why Participate?</h3><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><b>Reach a Dedicated Audience:</b> Connect with attendees of the Ubuntu Summit and the broader open-source and free culture communities.</li><li><b>Showcase Your Work:</b> Highlight your music and your commitment to open licenses.</li><li><b>Be Part of Something Unique:</b> This is an exciting opportunity to combine technology, community, and artistic expression in a truly open way.</li><li><b>Community &amp; Collaboration:</b> Join a lineup of like-minded artists and contribute to a unique cultural event.</li></ul><p></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Who We're Looking For:</h3><p>We're searching for individual musicians and bands who fit <i>ANY</i> of the following:</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><b>Release their music under Creative Commons licenses.</b> (e.g., CC BY, CC BY-SA, CC BY-NC – just let us know which one!)</li><li><b>Are comfortable with live streaming</b> and have the necessary equipment (a stable internet connection, decent audio/video setup).</li><li><b>Are passionate about open culture</b> and the intersection of art and technology.</li></ul><p></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">How to Get Involved:</h3><p>If you're a Creative Commons or open culture artist interested in performing and being part of this unique event, we'd love to hear from you!</p><p>Please fill out our <b>Artist Submission Form</b> by <b>October 10th, 2025</b>, to tell us about your music and your setup:</p><p>👉 <strike>Fill Out The Artist Submission Form Here</strike> 👈</p><p>We'll be reviewing submissions and building the schedule shortly after the deadline.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Help Us Spread the Word!</h3><p>Do you know any Creative Commons or open culture artists who fit the bill?

The more talent we gather, the more incredible this companion stream will be.</p><p>I believe this will be a fantastic way to celebrate the synergy between open source, free culture, and technology.
