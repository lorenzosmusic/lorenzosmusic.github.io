We've actually released <a href="https://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2018/08/rom-comm-mixtape.html">two</a> <a href="https://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2025/04/friction-album.html">albums</a> and <a href="https://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2020/02/spaghetti-mid-western-ep.html">two</a> <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3u4VKPanwkqi3iqIhaJYqw?si=PrhoOGomQvGRXnz8F13kpQ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">EPs</a> using this method.</p><p>I've looked around and haven't really noticed that anybody else has been using this same process that we do with music and GitHub. So I wanted to go through the things that we do to make this happen.<span></span></p><!--more--><p></p><p>In this post, I want to go over the basics of version control for musicians who are only somewhat familiar with GitHub and version control.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">What Git does - Version control basics&nbsp;</h2><p>So let's go over the core idea of GitHub, specifically version control, and why it's beneficial for collaborating on music projects to share full DAW sessions.&nbsp;</p><p>GitHub is normally used by software and web developers. It gives them a folder to not only store the code they're working on, but also allows people to branch off that folder as a new folder and test out code without affecting the original.&nbsp;</p><p>This folder on github.com, also known as a repository, is what gives us the ability to share recording sessions without losing the original sessions.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Using GitHub gives us the ability to share recording sessions without losing the original sessions</h3><p>One way to think about it is to imagine GitHub version control as a detailed history log for projects. And like I was saying, you can save every change you make as new versions by branching off the main folder.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the really cool things about this is you can even go back to previous versions, no matter when or who did the changes to the DAW session.&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Version control in GitHub is like creating a “save-as” file for each session</h3><p>Another way to think about it is that version control on GitHub is like creating a "save as" file for each session.</p><p>If you've ever had something that you're working on in a program like Photoshop or a Word document, you may have tried to save it as a new file like "v1" or "V2" in the name so you wouldn't lose the original or have to click undo 10 million times.</p><p>That's what GitHub is like. Except that it saves all of this in the original repository folder, you're not saving each change that you make as a new file or a new folder. You tell GitHub to track it as a new file.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Why GitHub for music?</h2><h3 style="text-align: left;">Github shares code &amp; folder structures</h3><p>Like I mentioned earlier, for developers, GitHub shares code and folder structures. That is also why we would use it for music projects.&nbsp;</p><p>A DAW program is essentially set up that same way. It is just a folder with a software code file and folder structures to store what it needs.</p><p>The file that you click on to open the recording session in the DAW software is just a code file. The changes made in that code file can be managed for sharing on GitHub. That's what GitHub does: it manages code for software.</p><p>You would think it's something that could be easily done by sharing it on Google Drive or Dropbox, and many people have tried that, including me.&nbsp;</p><p>But the code management is actually very important to interacting with a program file and folders like Dropbox and Google Drive can't manage that collaboratively.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">More later</h2><p>For right now, I just wanted to go over that particular introduction to how GitHub is the main component for this process, instead of managing multiple versions of a session, but the beginnings of a version that everybody can manage on their own laptop or computer.&nbsp;</p><p>Next, I will go over <a href="https://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2025/05/github-for-music-setting-up-daw-session.html">how we set up our DAW GitHub repository for recording sessions</a>.</p><div class="tomsbox"><h2 style="text-align: center;">Download My GitHub For Music Process</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><b>Download the whole process now!</b></p><p style="text-align: left;">This document explains my full method on how to use GitHub for collaborating on music projects with full DAW sessions.</p><p style="text-align: left;">The document outlines an unconventional way to use GitHub for music collaboration.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><a class="flat-button fancy-button fancy-blue" href="https://ko-fi.com/s/cd0ff1df59" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GET IT HERE!</a></p></div>
