<h3 style="text-align: left;">A story about how a simple beat I was working on turned into an artistic venture</h3><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" class="BLOG_video_class" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zl2EQRSHLV0" width="320" youtube-src-id="zl2EQRSHLV0"></iframe></div><h2 style="text-align: left;">It all started with a beat</h2><p>I was out at the studio and I was just messing around with a simple little beat using this drum machine program that I have called <a href="http://hydrogen-music.org/" target="_blank">Hydrogen</a>.</p><p>Then wrote a piano line to go along with the beat and added this <a href="https://calf-studio-gear.org/" target="_blank">Calf Studio</a> plug-in that's supposed to make it sound like <b>old vinyl</b>.</p><p>Then I messed around with a few more instruments to add to the song. One of them I added was a bassoon.</p><p>(<b>Watch the first 2 scenes here</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2021/09/first-2-scenes-animated-for-shore-leave.html">FIRST 2 SCENES ANIMATED FOR SHORE LEAVE VIDEO</a>)</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">It reminds me of something?</h2><p>As was listening to what I did so far a funny thing happened. It reminded me of something.&nbsp;</p><p>I started thinking of the movie "Big time" the live concert movie by <b>Tom Waits</b> that he did for his album "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franks_Wild_Years" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Frank's wild years</a>".</p><p>In particular, it made me think of the song "Shore leave" and that's a song I've wanted to cover for a while.</p><p>So I was like, what if I take what I have so far and do <b>Shore leave</b>? Do the version that's in that movie, not the version that's on his album.</p><p>I changed some of the parts that I had recorded to match the song, then added the vocals.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Then I got another idea</h2><p>As I was doing this I started getting another idea. I've been looking for something to animate, I've been looking for a cartoon to make and I'm like, what if I just animated this song? What if I animated my version of what it would be?</p><p>I pulled out the tablet that I have and I drew this picture of the character that I would use for the story.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjJE51YAGBzbM1mQrpE1A7RN9BQ5_bTZpxL1-7QcTs8FsCnKi9LQaKmLDbn-b9o2WoZ_fcnYgD8be70uVwqAXXFHhhv2udhKpar7NWiLpjjszHwm0ofHghrYYxCiuc-RwpJHmQC/s1200/Screenshot_20210906-214528_FlipaClip.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="illustration of a man holding a hat" border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="674" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjJE51YAGBzbM1mQrpE1A7RN9BQ5_bTZpxL1-7QcTs8FsCnKi9LQaKmLDbn-b9o2WoZ_fcnYgD8be70uVwqAXXFHhhv2udhKpar7NWiLpjjszHwm0ofHghrYYxCiuc-RwpJHmQC/w225-h400/Screenshot_20210906-214528_FlipaClip.jpg" title="Character sketch from my tablet" width="225" /></a></div><p>Now as I was working on the song I started storyboarding what the animation would be in my head.&nbsp;</p><p>I was thinking not only of writing the song but what I wanted the video to do!</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Set up the first animated scene using Blender Grease Pencil</h2><p>I've been wanting to mess with the animation software <a href="https://www.blender.org/" target="_blank">Blender</a>. Mainly with their <b>grease pencil</b> set up for 2D animation. I wanted to see what it's like? So I decided that this was going to be the project I would use to learn it.</p><p>I set up the first scene based on the drawing I did in the Blender software but it took me just as long to do this first scene as it took me to come up with the song!&nbsp;</p><p>I didn't want to wait so long to do all of this.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">I'll animate it as 6-second video segments</h2><p>The animated segment I did of the song so far was only a few seconds long so I thought, what if i just animated it six seconds at a time?&nbsp;</p><p>I thought of it kind of like an <b>Instagram story</b> or one of those&nbsp;<b>YouTube shorts</b>.&nbsp;</p><p>What if I just created and released segments from the song piece by piece as I go along? Releasing these as I'm animating it!&nbsp;</p><p>That's where I'm at right now. I'm gonna be releasing this song animation in short segments.</p><p>So that's the story about how I started working on a beat that became a much bigger thing!</p><p>-Tom&nbsp;</p><div class="lorenzosbox" style="border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); padding: 20px; text-align: center;"><h2>Lorenzo's Music email list</h2><p>Sign up to hear about when we release new songs or videos</p><!--Begin Mailchimp Signup Form-->
