<p>Jason over at the Insomnia Radio Podcast just featured two of our songs at the opening of <a href="http://insomniaradio.net/2006/08/27/insomnia-radio-101-save-for-a-rainy-day/">episode #101</a>. And gave a mention and some kudos to the public Lorenzo's Music video idea I had. (sadly none to show as of yet.) Go on over and check out his show if you haven't already.</p>  <p>Plus you might have noticed in the past couple of days our photos were missing. Our old photo server changed their account services so we moved over to Flickr. If you're subscribed to our photos feed you'll want to switch over to the new one.</p>
