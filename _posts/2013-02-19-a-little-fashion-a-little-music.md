&nbsp;A fan sent us a link to this video for a photo shoot of the <b>Miss University International</b> promo. It uses our song "<a href="http://lorenzosmusic.bandcamp.com/track/you-got-to-feel-it-tonight?utm_source=videopost&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=miss%2Buniversity">You got to feel it tonight</a>" as the background music. I'd say it fits quite nicely, wouldn't you?
