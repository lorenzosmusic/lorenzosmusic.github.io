This post is from several years ago and the links on it aren't even valid anymore, yet for some reason it continues to be the most popular post on our website.<br />
<br />
So instead of just deleting it and people being sent to a "link not found page" we thought we'd just post this message and a link to our <a href="http://www.lorenzosmusic.com/p/albums.html">album page</a>. :)<br />

We're featured once again as one of the musical guests on the insightful and topical "You Are The Guest" podcast from Fort Dodge, Iowa.<br />
<br />
On this show, host Bill Grady talks to a man from Orlando, Florida who is on active Navy duty stationed in Japan. And they talk about his first day in Japan, the recent elections in Japan, what changes he has noticed about American society after living in Japan, the high cost of living in Japan, and how America is viewed by the Japanese people.<br />
