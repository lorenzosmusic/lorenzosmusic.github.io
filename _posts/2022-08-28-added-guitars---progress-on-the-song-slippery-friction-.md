So we started expanding on it and multi-tracking it.<span></span></p><!--more--><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Slippery Friction with guitar session</h2><p>Here is the song arrangement we have so far that you can listen to.</p><p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="44" mozallowfullscreen="true" src="https://archive.org/embed/slippery-friction-guitar-more-melody_session_220418" webkitallowfullscreen="true" width="500"></iframe></p><p>In the last recording session, <a href="https://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2022/08/progress-on-song-idea-slippery-friction.html">we created some drum loops and bass</a>. But felt like it needed some guitars.</p><p>Here is what we did in this version.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Added new guitar part</h2><p>We had Eric lay down some guitar ideas.</p><p>We recorded several guitar tracks to use and tried different things with each take. Part of the guitar line was based on a vocal melody idea from another song we're working on.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Chopped up the different guitar tracks into a new one</h2><p>After the session, I took parts from all of the guitar tracks we recorded and chopped them up into a new line for the song.</p><p>Also panned two different guitar parts left and right on the ending because I couldn't decide which version I liked more. So I used both! 😁</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Not there yet</h2><p>I like it as a start. Listening back I want to try spacing out the guitar parts in the next version.</p><p>-Tom</p><div class="tomsbox"><h2 style="text-align: left;">Don't Forget!</h2><p>Want to see more live stream clips and videos?
